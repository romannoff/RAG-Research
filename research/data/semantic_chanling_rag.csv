Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons.[2] The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors.[3] Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.', 'A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average.[15] The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit.', 'All muscles in the body are affected.']",Somatic

Opsins belong to a family of photo-sensitive proteins and fall into nine groups, which already existed in the urbilaterian, the last common ancestor of all bilateral symmetrical animals.[16] Additionally, the genetic toolkit for positioning eyes is shared by all animals: The PAX6 gene controls where eyes develop in animals ranging from octopuses[17] to mice and fruit flies.[18][19][20] Such high-level genes are, by implication, much older than many of the structures that they control today; they must originally have served a different purpose, before they were co-opted for eye development.[15]\nEyes and other sensory organs probably evolved before the brain: There is no need for an information-processing organ (brain) before there is information to process.[21]\nStages of eye evolution[edit]\nThe stigma (2) of the euglena hides a light-sensitive spot.']",photoreceptor proteins that sense light

31,when are centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants used,"Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in various neurological conditions. They are commonly prescribed for low back pain, neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents and are generally not more effective than paracetamol or NSAIDs in acute low back pain or more effective than antidepressants in fibromyalgia. They are often chosen based on their adverse-effect profile, tolerability, and cost. Dantrolene, while primarily thought of as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects. Baclofen's activity is strictly associated with the CNS. These medications are thought to be useful in painful disorders because pain induces spasm and spasm causes pain.","['Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of carisoprodol in 1959, metaxalone in August 1962, and cyclobenzaprine in August 1977.[7]\nOther skeletal muscle relaxants of that type used around the world come from a number of drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen, [8] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax skeletal muscles include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some ketobemidone, piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic.', 'Spasmolytics, also known as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions.', 'Terminology[edit]\nBecause they may act at the level of the cortex, brain stem or spinal cord, or all three areas, they have traditionally been referred to as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants.', 'According to MeSH, dantrolene is usually classified as a centrally acting muscle relaxant.[10] The World Health Organization, in its ATC, uses the term ""centrally acting agents"",[11] but adds a distinct category of ""directly acting agents"", for dantrolene.[12] Use of this terminology dates back to at least 1973.[13]\nThe term ""spasmolytic"" is also considered a synonym for antispasmodic.[14]\nClinical use[edit]\nSpasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and methocarbamol are commonly prescribed for low back pain or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome.[15] However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),[16][17] and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants.[15] Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs.[18] In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use.[15] No drug has been shown to be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness.[15][17] Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use.[15] A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse-effect profile, tolerability, and cost.[19]\nMuscle relaxants (according to one study) were not advised for orthopedic conditions, but rather for neurological conditions such as spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.[15] Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.

15:33.', 'The fifth edition, published on 10 February 1869, incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase ""survival of the fittest"", which had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Biology (1864).[86]\nIn January 1871, George Jackson Mivart\'s On the Genesis of Species listed detailed arguments against natural selection, and claimed it included false metaphysics.[87] Darwin made extensive revisions to the sixth edition of the Origin (this was the first edition in which he used the word ""evolution"" which had commonly been associated with embryological development, though all editions concluded with the word ""evolved""[88][89]), and added a new chapter VII, Miscellaneous objections, to address Mivart\'s arguments.[2][90]\nThe sixth edition was published by Murray on 19 February 1872 as The Origin of Species, with ""On"" dropped from the title.', 'The text of Origin itself has been subject to much analysis including a variorum, detailing the changes made in every edition, first published in 1959,[254] and a concordance, an exhaustive external index published in 1981.[255] Worldwide commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species and the bicentenary of Darwin\'s birth were scheduled for 2009.[256] They celebrated the ideas which ""over the last 150 years have revolutionised our understanding of nature and our place within it"".[257]\nIn a survey conducted by a group of academic booksellers, publishers and librarians in advance of Academic Book Week in the United Kingdom, On the Origin of Species was voted the most influential academic book ever written.[258] It was hailed as ""the supreme demonstration of why academic books matter"" and ""a book which has changed the way we think about everything"".[259]\nSee also[edit]\nBook: Evolution\nOn the Origin of Species – full text at Wikisource of the first edition, 1859\nThe

Conclusion"".[67] Murray responded immediately with an agreement to publish the book on the same terms as he published Lyell, without even seeing the manuscript: he offered Darwin \u200b2⁄3 of the profits.[68] Darwin promptly accepted with pleasure, insisting that Murray would be free to withdraw the offer if, having read the chapter manuscripts, he felt the book would not sell well.[69] (eventually Murray paid £180 to Darwin for the 1st edition and by Darwin\'s death in 1882 the book was in its 6th edition, earning Darwin nearly £3000.[70])\nOn 5 April, Darwin sent Murray the first three chapters, and a proposal for the book\'s title.[71] An early draft title page suggests On the Mutability of Species.[72] Murray cautiously asked Whitwell Elwin to review the chapters.[59] At Lyell\'s suggestion, Elwin recommended that, rather than ""put forth the theory without the evidence"", the book should focus on observations upon pigeons, briefly stating how these illustrated Darwin\'s general principles and preparing the way for the larger work expected shortly: ""Every body is interested in pigeons.""[73] Darwin responded that this was impractical: he had only the last chapter still to write.[74] In September the main title still included ""An essay on the origin of species and varieties"", but Darwin now proposed dropping ""varieties"".[75]\nWith Murray\'s persuasion, the title was eventually agreed as On the Origin of Species, with the title page adding by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.[3] In this extended title (and elsewhere in the book) Darwin used the biological term ""races"" interchangeably with ""varieties"", meaning varieties within a species.[76][77] He used the term broadly,[78] and as well as discussions of ""the several races, for instance, of the cabbage"" and ""the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants"",[79] there are three instances in the

research[edit]\nThe most important clue linking the tsunami in Japan and the earthquake in the Pacific Northwest comes from studies of tree rings (dendrochronology), which show that several ""ghost forests"" of red cedar trees in Oregon and Washington, killed by lowering of coastal forests into the tidal zone by the earthquake, have outermost growth rings that formed in 1699, the last growing season before the tsunami.[6] This includes both inland stands of trees, such as one on the Copalis River in Washington,[6] and pockets of tree stumps that are now under the ocean surface and become exposed only at low tide.[7]\nSediment layers in these locations demonstrate a pattern consistent with seismic and tsunami events around this time.[8] Core samples from the ocean floor, as well as

It is served with a variety of side dishes which vary from traditional dishes such as mashed potatoes, stuffing, and cranberry sauce,[1] to ones that reflect regional or cultural heritage.[2] The majority of the dishes in the traditional American version of Thanksgiving dinner are made from foods native to the New World, as according to tradition the Pilgrims received these foods, or learned how to grow them, from the Native Americans.[3] Thanksgiving dinner is the largest eating event in the United States; people eat more on Thanksgiving than on any other day of the

introduction of Stage3D, a number of older 2D engines or isometric engines like Flixel saw their heyday.[68]\nAdobe also developed the CrossBridge toolkit which cross-compiles C/C++ code to run within the Flash Player, using LLVM and GCC as compiler backends, and high-performance memory-access opcodes in the Flash Player (termed ""Domain Memory"") to work with in-memory data quickly.[69] CrossBridge is targeted toward the game development industry,[70] and includes tools for building, testing, and debugging C/C++ projects in Flash Player.', 'It introduced the ActionScript 3.0 programming language, which supported modern programming practices and enabled business applications to be developed with Flash.', 'Various 3D frameworks have been built for Flash using Stage3D, such as Away3D 4,[46] CopperCube,[47] Flare3D,[48] Starling,.[49]:vii Professional game engines like Unreal Engine[50][51] and Unity also export Flash versions which use Stage3D to render 3D graphics.', 'In 2011, Adobe Flash Player 11 was released, and with it the first version of Stage3D, allowing GPU-accelerated 3D rendering for Flash applications and games on desktop platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.[28] Adobe further improved 3D capabilities from 2011 to 2013, adding support for 3D rendering on Android and iOS platforms, alpha-channels, compressed textures, texture atlases, and other features.[29][30] Adobe AIR was upgraded to support 64-bit computers, and to allow developers to add additional functionality to the AIR runtime using AIR Native Extensions (ANE).', 'Unlike Wallaby, which was a standalone program, the ""Toolkit for CreateJS"" only works as a plug-in inside Flash Professional; it generates output for the HTML5 canvas, animated with JavaScript.[126][127]

video and audio content.[3] In 2005, YouTube was founded by former PayPal employees, and it used Flash Player as a means to display compressed video content on the web.[3]\nBetween 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites to launch new products, or to create interactive company portals.[4] Notable users include Nike, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, General Electric, World Wildlife Fund, HBO, Cartoon Network and Disney.[4][5] After Adobe introduced hardware-accelerated 3D for Flash (Stage3D), Flash websites saw a growth of 3D content for product demonstrations and virtual tours.[6][7]\nIn 2007, YouTube offered videos in HTML5 format to support the iPhone and iPad, which did not support Flash Player.[3] After a controversy with Apple, Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile, focussing its efforts on Adobe AIR applications and HTML5 animation.[3] In 2015, Google introduced Google Swiffy to convert Flash animation to HTML5, a tool Google would use to automatically convert Flash web ads for mobile devices.[8] In 2015, YouTube switched to HTML5 technology on all devices, however it will preserve the Flash-based video player for older web browsers.[9][10][11]\nRIAs[edit]\nAfter Flash 5 introduced ActionScript in 2000, developers combined the visual and programming capabilities of Flash to produce interactive experiences and applications for the Web.[12] Such Web-based applications eventually came to be known as ""Rich Internet Applications"" (RIAs).[12]\nIn 2004, Macromedia Flex was released, and specifically targeted the application development market.[12] Flex introduced new user interface components, advanced data visualization components, data remoting, and a modern IDE (Flash Builder).[12][13] Flex competed with Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and Microsoft Silverlight during its tenure.[12] Flex was upgraded to support integration with remote data sources, using AMF, BlazeDS, Adobe LiveCycle, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and others.[14] As of 2015, Flex applications can be published for desktop platforms using Adobe AIR.[12]\nBetween 2006 and 2016, the Speedtest.net web service conducted over 9.0 billion speed tests using an RIA built with Adobe Flash.[15][16] In 2016, the service shifted to HTML5 due to the decreasing availability of Adobe Flash Player on PCs.[17]\nAs of 2016, Web

system of El Salvador\nThe Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.', 'Spain[edit]\nSpain is a unitary state with a high level of decentralisation, often regarded as a federal system in all but name or a ""federation without federalism"".[35] The country has been quoted as being ""an extraordinarily decentralized country"", with the central government accounting for just 18% of public spending,[36] 38% for the regional governments, 13% for the local councils, and the remaining 31% for the social security system.[37] The current Spanish constitution has been implemented in such a way that, in many respects, Spain can be compared to countries which are undeniably federal.[38]\nHowever, in order to manage the tensions present in the Spanish transition to democracy, the drafters of the current Spanish constitution avoided giving labels such as \'federal\' to the territorial arrangements.[39] Besides, unlike in the federal system, the main taxes are taken centrally from Madrid (except for the Basque Country and Navarre, which were recognized in the Spanish democratic constitution as charter territories drawing from historical reasons) and then distributed to the Autonomous Communities.', ""The remaining 64 are elected in 14 multi-member constituencies (corresponding to El

142,what is nginx and what is it used for,"Nginx is a web server that can also function as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. It is known for its efficient handling of high volumes of concurrent connections with a low memory footprint. It supports various protocols like HTTP, HTTP/1.1, WebSockets, and TLS/SSL. Nginx is widely used due to its scalability and performance advantages over traditional web servers like Apache. It is particularly effective for serving static files and handling dynamic content through FastCGI, SCGI, and WSGI interfaces.","[""According to W3Techs, it was used by 37.7% of the top 1 million websites, 49.7% of the top 100,000 websites, and by 57.0% of the top 10,000 websites.[13] According to BuiltWith, it is used on 38.2% of the top 10,000 websites, and its growth within the top 10k, 100k and 1 million segments increased.[14] Wikipedia uses Nginx as its SSL termination proxy.[15] As of OpenBSD release 5.2 (1 November 2012), Nginx became part of the OpenBSD base system, providing an alternative to the system's fork of Apache 1.3, which it was intended to replace,[16] but it was later replaced by OpenBSD's own httpd(8).[17]\nFeatures[edit]\nNginx can be deployed to serve dynamic HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and it can serve as a software load balancer.[18]\nNginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach to handling requests."", 'Initial release\n4\xa0October 2004;
