0,all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are,All the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are lower motor neurons located in the spinal cord and hindbrain. These neurons directly innervate voluntary muscles in the body. [7],"['Motor control', 'Motor systems are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain.[7] Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming', 'A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.[1] There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons', '.[2] The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors.[3] Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.', 'Further specification of motor neurons occurs when retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, Wnts, and TGFb, are integrated into the various Hox transcription factors. There are 13 Hox transcription factors and- along with the signals- these determine whether a motor neuron will be more rostral or caudal in character. In the spinal column Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns.[7] These columns are further explained in the table below.\nMotor Columns of Spinal Cord [8]\nMotor Column\nLocation in Spinal Cord\nTarget\nMedian Motor Column\nPresent entire length\nAxial muscles', 'Present entire length\nAxial muscles\nHypaxial Motor Column\nThoracic Region\nBody wall muscles\nPreganglionic Motor Column\nThoracic Region\nSympathetic ganglion\nLaterl Motor Column\nBrachial and Lumbar region (both regions are further divided into medial and lateral domains)\nMuscles of the limbs\nPhrenic Motor Coulmn\nCervical Region\nDiaphragm[9]\nAnatomy and physiology[edit]\nSpinal cord tracts\nLocation of lower motor neurons in spinal cord\nUpper motor neurons[edit]', 'Somatic motor neurons[edit]\nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles [14] (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons, beta efferent neurons, and gamma efferent neurons. They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.', 'Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the main force-generating component of a muscle. Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called ventral horn cells. A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average.[15] The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. Motor units are split up into 3 categories:[16] Main Article: Motor Unit', 'In consequence:\nthe motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic (involving only one motor neuron, respectively, somatic and branchial, which synapses onto the muscle).\nthe command of visceral muscles is disynaptic (involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron located in the CNS, which synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle).', 'All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Parasympathetic ganglionic neurons are also cholinergic, whereas most sympathetic ganglionic neurons are noradrenergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter noradrenaline.

6,what is the first step in the evolution of the eye,"The first step in the evolution of the eye was the emergence of photoreceptor proteins that sense light, known as ""eyespots.""

Complex, image-forming eyes have evolved independently several times.[1] The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion. According his theory, the genes engaged with photoreceptor cells (so called Pax 6 genes) appeared probably at once in the life history, at a very early stage of the evolution', '. [2] Probably, the complex, image forming kinds of eyes are at least five: Chidaria - lens eye, complex eye; Molluscs - lens eye, everse retina; Annelids- lens eye, everse retina; Arthropods - facet eye; Vertebrate- lens eye, inverse retina [3]', 'Complex eyes appeared first within the few million years of the Cambrian explosion. From before the Cambrian, no evidence of eyes has survived, but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale.[4] Eyes are adapted to the various requirements of their owners. They vary in their visual acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in low light, their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 History of research\n2 Rate of evolution', '1 History of research\n2 Rate of evolution\n3 One origin or many?\n4 Stages of eye evolution\n4.1 Early eyes\n4.2 Lens formation and diversification\n4.3 Other developments\n4.3.1 Color vision\n4.3.2 Polarization vision\n4.3.3 Focusing mechanism\n4.3.4 Location\n5 Evolutionary baggage\n6 Footnotes\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 Further reading\n10 External links\nHistory of research[edit]\nThe human eye, showing the iris', 'He suggested a stepwise evolution from ""an optic nerve merely coated with pigment, and without any other mechanism"" to ""a moderately high stage of perfection"", and gave examples of existing intermediate steps.[5] Darwin\'s suggestions were soon shown to be correct, and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution.[6]', ""Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors.[7] Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classical paper how many generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates.[8] Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through.[9] All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory.\nRate of evolution[edit]"", 'Rate of evolution[edit]\nThe first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period (about 540\xa0million years ago).[10] The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the ""Cambrian explosion"". One of the many hypotheses for ""causes"" of the Cambrian explosion is the ""Light Switch"" theory of Andrew Parker: It holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution.[11] Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision.', 'The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate, because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals', 'Eyes and other sensory organs probably evolved before the brain: There is no need for an information-processing organ (brain) before there is information to process.[21]\nStages of eye evolution[edit]\nThe stigma (2) of the euglena hides a light-sensitive spot.', 'The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called ""eyespots"". Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They are insufficient for vision, as they cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from. Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups, and are common among unicellular organisms, including euglena']",photoreceptor proteins that sense light

15,when did beds become popular in france and germany,"Beds became popular in France and Germany in the 12th century, with luxurious bedsteads decorated with inlaid, carved, and painted ornamentation. By the 14th century, four-poster beds and richly embroidered coverlets and mattresses appeared. In the 15th century, beds grew larger and reached 7 to 8 feet by 6 to 7 feet.","[""Medieval Europe\nThe ancient Germans lay on the floor on beds of leaves covered with skins, or in a kind of shallow chest filled with leaves and moss. In the early Middle Ages they laid carpets on the floor or on a bench against the wall, placed upon them mattresses stuffed with feathers, wool, or hair, and used skins as a covering. Curtains were hung from the ceiling or from an iron arm projecting from the wall.[8] They appear to have generally lain naked in bed, wrapping themselves in large linen sheets which were stretched over the cushions.\nSouthampton Medieval Merchant's House bedroom"", 'In the 12th century, luxury increased and bedsteads were made of wood much decorated with inlaid, carved, and painted ornamentation. They also used folding beds, which served as couches by day and had cushions covered with silk laid upon leather. At night a linen sheet was spread and pillows placed, while silk-covered skins served as coverlets. The Carolingian manuscripts show metal bedsteads much higher at the head than at the feet, and this shape continued in use until the 13th century in France, many cushions being added to raise the body to a sloping position', '. In 12th-century manuscripts, the bedsteads appear much richer, with inlays, carving, and painting, and with embroidered coverlets and mattresses in harmony. Curtains were hung above the bed and a small hanging lamp is often shown.', 'In the 14th century the woodwork became of less importance, generally being entirely covered by hangings of rich materials. Silk, velvet, and even cloth of gold were frequently used. Inventories from the beginning of the 14th century give details of these hangings lined with fur and richly embroidered. It was then that the Four poster bed (also known as a tester bed) made its first appearance, the bed being slung from the ceiling or fastened to the walls, a form which developed later into a room within a room, shut in by double curtains, sometimes even to exclude all drafts', '. The space between bed and wall was called the ruelle, and very intimate friends were received there. The 14th century is also the time when feather beds became highly prized possessions.[8]', 'In the 15th century beds became very large, reaching 7 to 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4\xa0m) by 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1\xa0m). The mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks, straw, or feathers. At this time great personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property about with them, including beds and bed-hangings, and for this reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks to be covered up; but about the beginning of the 16th century bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative, since the lords remained in the same place for longer periods.\nRenaissance and modern Europe', 'In the 17th century, which has been called ""the century of magnificent beds"", the style a la duchesse, with tester and curtains only at the head, replaced the more enclosed beds in France, though they lasted much longer in England. Louis XIV had an enormous number of sumptuous beds, as many as 413 being described in the inventories of his palaces. Some of them had embroideries enriched with pearls, and figures on a silver or golden ground. The great bed at Versailles had crimson velvet curtains on which ""The Triumph of Venus"" was embroidered', '. So much gold was used that the velvet scarcely showed.', 'Napoleon I\'s bed\nIn the 18th century feather pillows were first used as coverings in Germany, which in the fashions of the bed and the curious etiquette connected with the bedchamber followed France for the most part. The beds were a la duchesse, but in France itself there was great variety both of name and shape. The custom of the ""bed of justice"" upon which the king of France reclined when he was present in parliament, the princes being seated, the great officials standing, and the lesser officials kneeling, was held to denote the royal power even more than the throne.', 'Louis XI is credited with its first use and the custom lasted till the end of the monarchy. In the chambre de parade, where the ceremonial bed was placed, certain persons, such as ambassadors or great lords, whom it was desired to honour, were received in a more intimate fashion than the crowd of courtiers. At Versailles women received their friends in their beds, both before and after childbirth, during periods of mourning, and even directly after marriage—in fact in any circumstances which were thought deserving of congratulation or condolence', '. During the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used in high society in France till the end of the Ancien Régime. The earliest of which mention has been found belonged to Charles the Bold. They had curtains over a light framework, and were in their way as fine as the stationary beds.', ""Iron beds appear in the 18th century; the advertisements declare them as free from the insects which sometimes infested wooden bedsteads. Elsewhere, there was also the closed bed with sliding or folding shutters, and in England—where beds were commonly quite simple in form—the four poster was the usual citizen's bed until the middle of the 19th century.\nBed sizes\nMain article: Bed size""]",the 12th century

The term ""gymnosperm"" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, ""naked"" and σπέρμα sperma, ""seed""), meaning ""naked seeds"". The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary', '. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or solitary as in Yew, Torreya, Ginkgo.[1]', 'The gymnosperms and angiosperms together compose the spermatophytes or seed plants. The gymnosperms are divided into six phyla. Organisms that belong to the Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Gnetophyta, and Pinophyta (also known as Coniferophyta) phyla are still in existence while those in the Pteridospermales and Cordaitales phyla are now extinct.[2]', 'Diversity and origin[edit]\nThere are more than 1000[1] extant or currently living species of gymnosperms in 88[1] plant genera belonging to 14 plant families.', 'It is widely accepted that the gymnosperms originated in the late Carboniferous period, replacing the lycopsid rainforests of the tropical region.[8] [9] This appears to have been the result of a whole genome duplication event around 319\xa0million years ago.[10] Early characteristics of seed plants were evident in fossil progymnosperms of the late Devonian period around 383 million years ago', 'Life cycle[edit]\nExample of gymnosperm lifecycle', 'Gymnosperms, like all vascular plants, have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle, which means they spend most of their life cycle with diploid cells, while the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived. Two spore types, microspores and megaspores, are typically produced in pollen cones or ovulate cones, respectively. Gametophytes, as with all heterosporous plants, develop within the spore wall. Pollen grains (microgametophytes) mature from microspores, and ultimately produce sperm cells. Megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule', '. Gymnosperms produce multiple archegonia, which produce the female gamete. During pollination, pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from the pollen cone to the ovule. Pollen is usually moved by wind or insects. Whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle. The pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms', '. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat.[16]']",either on the surface of scales or leaves

30,how often does a speed limit sign need to be posted,No answer,"['Most public roads in most countries have a legally assigned numerical maximum speed limit which applies on all roads unless otherwise stated; lower speed limits are often shown on a sign at the start of the restricted section, although the presence of streetlights or the physical arrangement of the road may sometimes also be used instead. A posted speed limit may only apply to that road or to all roads beyond the sign that defines them depending on local laws', '. In the European Union, large signposts showing the national (default) speed limits of the respective country are usually erected immediately after border crossings, with a repeater sign some 200 to 500\xa0m (660 to 1,640\xa0ft) after the first sign. Some places provide an additional ""speed zone ahead"" ahead of the restriction and speed limit reminder signs may appear at regular intervals which may be painted on the road surface.', 'Signs are normally placed on both sides of the road and in some places there are small (less than 1/4 the size of the sign) rectangular orange reflector flags attached to both upper right corners of both signs. The speed limit sign marking the new speed zone may also have the orange flags; this practice can be observed in New York on highways where the speed limit varies such as New York State Route 17.\nSpeed limits on European Motorways in km/h', 'Speed limits on European Motorways in km/h\nSignage in many countries, especially in Europe, conforms to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals using black text with a red circle on a white background.', 'In the United States, the signs are usually rectangular with the words ""SPEED LIMIT"" and the values in black on a white background. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration\'s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides guidelines for the appearance of speed limit signs. In Alaska and California, speed limits are often labeled ""MAXIMUM SPEED"" instead. In Oregon, most speed limit signs just say ""SPEED"" and the number. Canada has similar signs bearing the legend ""MAXIMUM"" and in km/h instead of mph', '. ""Maximum"" is used instead of ""Speed Limit"" because it has similar meanings in English and French.

31,when are centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants used,"Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms, reduce spasticity in various neurological conditions, and treat tension headaches. They are commonly prescribed for low back pain, neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents and have limited effectiveness compared to paracetamol or NSAIDs. Their use is limited due to concerns about potential abuse, sedative effects, and interactions with other medications. No specific drug has been proven superior over others, and all have similar side effects including dizziness and drowsiness. Dantrolene, while primarily considered a peripheral agent, exhibits CNS effects, and baclofen's activity is strictly CNS-associated. Muscle relaxants are not typically approved for long-term use but may be prescribed by rheumatologists to improve sleep quality in fibromyalgia patients.","['A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone. It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, and hyperreflexia. The term ""muscle relaxant"" is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics. Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system (CNS) activity. They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis', '. Spasmolytics, also known as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions. While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants,[1][2] the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only.[3][4]', 'Other skeletal muscle relaxants of that type used around the world come from a number of drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen, [8] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax skeletal muscles include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination', 'properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some ketobemidone, piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic', 'The generation of the neuronal signals in motor neurons that cause muscle contractions are dependent on the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition the motor neuron receives. Spasmolytic agents generally work by either enhancing the level of inhibition, or reducing the level of excitation. Inhibition is enhanced by mimicking or enhancing the actions of endogenous inhibitory substances, such as GABA.\nTerminology[edit]', 'Terminology[edit]\nBecause they may act at the level of the cortex, brain stem or spinal cord, or all three areas, they have traditionally been referred to as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants. However, it is now known not every agent in this class has CNS activity (e.g. dantrolene), so this name is inaccurate.[5]', 'Most sources still use the term ""centrally acting muscle relaxant"". According to MeSH, dantrolene is usually classified as a centrally acting muscle relaxant.[10] The World Health Organization, in its ATC, uses the term ""centrally acting agents"",[11] but adds a distinct category of ""directly acting agents"", for dantrolene.[12] Use of this terminology dates back to at least 1973.[13]\nThe term ""spasmolytic"" is also considered a synonym for antispasmodic.[14]\nClinical use[edit]', 'Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and methocarbamol are commonly prescribed for low back pain or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome.[15] However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),[16][17] and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants.[15] Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs', '.[18] In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use.[15] No drug has been shown to be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness.[15][17] Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use.[15] A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse-effect profile, tolerability, and cost.[19]', 'Muscle relaxants (according to one study) were not advised for orthopedic conditions, but rather for neurological conditions such as spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.[15] Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.\nMuscle relaxants are thought to be useful in painful disorders based on the theory that pain induces spasm and spasm causes pain. However, considerable evidence contradicts this theory.[18]', 'In general, muscle relaxants are not approved by FDA for long-term use. However, rheumatologists often prescribe cyclobenzaprine nightly on a daily basis to increase stage 4 sleep. By increasing this sleep stage, patients feel more refreshed in the morning. Improving sleep is also beneficial for patients who have fibromyalgia.[20]\nMuscle relaxants such as tizanidine are prescribed in the treatment of tension headaches.[21]']",to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions

34,who decides the number of judges in the high court,The number of judges in the High Court is defined by the President of India.,"['Qualifications of High Court Judges[edit]\nEach High Court could consist of a chief justice and up to 15 judges. Under §3 of the Act, judges could be selected from barristers (with 5 years of experience), civil servants (with 10 years of experience including 3 years as a zillah judge), judges of small cause courts or sudder ameen (with 5 years of experience), or pleaders of lander courts or High Courts (with 05 years of experience).', 'The High Court of a State is the highest court of the State and all other courts of the State work under it. Normally there is one High Court in every State but there can be only one High Court for two or more States as well, according to the constitution. There is one High Court at Chandigarh for Punjab, Haryana and Union Territory of Chandigarh. Similarly there is one High Court at Guwahati which serves Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland.\nComposition:\nIn every High Court, there is a Chief Justice and many other judges whose number is defined by the President of India.', 'Appointment of the Judges: The Chief Justice of a High Court is appointed by the President with the consultation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Governor of the State. The other judges are appointed by the will of President, Governor and the Chief Justice of High Court.\nQualifications for the Judges\n(a) He should be a citizen of India.\n(b) He should have been (I) a judge for 10 years of Subordinate court under the Judicial Service of the State or (ii) an Advocate for 10 years in a High Courts in India (Article 217).', 'Tenure: Originally the age of the retirement of the judges of the High Courts was fixed at 60 but it was raised to 62 in 1963 according to the 15th amendment of the Constitution.', 'The Supreme Court of the United States (sometimes colloquially referred to by the acronym SCOTUS)[2] is the highest federal court of the United States. Established pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution in 1789, it has ultimate (and largely discretionary) appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts and state court cases involving issues of federal law plus original jurisdiction over a small range of cases', '. In the legal system of the United States, the Supreme Court is generally the final interpreter of federal law including the United States Constitution, but it may act only within the context of a case in which it has jurisdiction. The Court may decide cases having political overtones but does not have power to decide nonjusticiable political questions, and its enforcement arm is in the executive rather than judicial branch of government.', 'According to federal statute, the Court normally consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed after impeachment (though no justice has ever been removed).[3] In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation', "". Each justice has one vote, and it is worth noting that while a far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously, decisions in cases of the highest profile have often come down to just one single vote, thereby exposing the justices' ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories. The Court meets in the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C."", 'Supreme Court of the United States\nThe ratification of the United States Constitution established the Supreme Court in 1789. Its powers are detailed in Article Three of the Constitution. The Supreme Court was the only court specifically established by the Constitution while all other federal courts were created by Congress. Congress is also responsible for conferring the title of ""justice"" to its members, who are known to scold lawyers for inaccurately referring to them as ""judge"", even though it is the term used in the Constitution.[4]', 'The Court first convened on February 2, 1790,[5] with six judges where only five of its six initial positions were filled. According to historian Fergus Bordewich, in its first session: ""[T]he Supreme Court convened for the first time at the Royal Exchange Building on Broad Street, a few steps from Federal Hall. Symbolically, the moment was pregnant with promise for the republic, this birth of a new national institution whose future power, admittedly, still existed only in the eyes and minds of just a few visionary Americans']",the President of India

The largest pearl oyster is the Pinctada maxima, which is roughly the size of a dinner plate. South Sea pearls are characterized by their large size and warm luster. Sizes up to 14\xa0mm in diameter are not uncommon. In 2013, Indonesia Pearl[42] supplied 43 percent of South Sea Pearls international market.[43] The other significant producers are Australia, Philippines, Myanmar and Malaysia.[44]\nFreshwater pearl farming[edit]', 'In 1914, pearl farmers began growing cultured freshwater pearls using the pearl mussels native to Lake Biwa. This lake, the largest and most ancient in Japan, lies near the city of Kyoto. The extensive and successful use of the Biwa Pearl Mussel is reflected in the name Biwa pearls, a phrase which was at one time nearly synonymous with freshwater pearls in general. Since the time of peak production in 1971, when Biwa pearl farmers produced six tons of cultured pearls, pollution has caused the virtual extinction of the industry']",the Indian Ocean

The structure of the intact ATP synthase is currently known at low-resolution from electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of the complex. The cryo-EM model of ATP synthase suggests that the peripheral stalk is a flexible structure that wraps around the complex as it joins F1 to FO.

The enzyme then undergoes a change in shape and forces these molecules together, with the active site in the resulting ""tight"" state (shown in red) binding the newly produced ATP molecule with very high affinity. Finally, the active site cycles back to the open state (orange), releasing ATP and binding more ADP and phosphate, ready for the next cycle of ATP production.[12]', 'Physiological role[edit]\nLike other enzymes, the activity of F1FO ATP synthase is reversible.

43,what is the point of a menstrual cup,"The point of a menstrual cup is to collect menstrual flow inside the vagina rather than absorbing it, allowing for reuse over time. It is typically made of silicone and can last up to 5 years.","['Cramps\nFurther information: Dysmenorrhea\nMany women experience painful cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, during menstruation.[13] Pain results from ischemia and muscle contractions. Spiral arteries in the secretory endometrium constrict, resulting in ischemia to the secretory endometrium. This allows the uterine lining to slough off. The myometrium contracts spasmodically in order to push the menstrual fluid through the cervix and out of the vagina. The contractions are mediated by a release of prostaglandins.', 'Painful menstrual cramps that result from an excess of prostaglandin release are referred to as primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea usually begins within a year or two of menarche, typically with the onset of ovulatory cycles.[14] Treatments that target the mechanism of pain include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hormonal contraceptives. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin production. With long-term treatment, hormonal birth control reduces the amount of uterine fluid/tissue expelled from the uterus. Thus resulting in shorter, less painful menstruation', '.[15] These drugs are typically more effective than treatments that do not target the source of the pain (e.g. acetaminophen).[16] Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include: early age at menarche, long or heavy menstrual periods, smoking, and a family history of dysmenorrhea.[14] Regular physical activity may limit the severity of uterine cramps.[14]', 'Bleeding\nThe average volume of menstrual fluid during a monthly menstrual period is 35 milliliters (2.4 tablespoons of menstrual fluid) with 10–80 milliliters (1–6 tablespoons of menstrual fluid) considered typical. Menstrual fluid is the correct name for the flow, although many people prefer to refer to it as menstrual blood. Menstrual fluid contains some blood, as well as cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood.[10]:p. 381', 'About half of menstrual fluid is blood. This blood contains sodium, calcium, phosphate, iron, and chloride, the extent of which depends on the woman. As well as blood, the fluid consists of cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Vaginal fluids in menses mainly contribute water, common electrolytes, organ moieties, and at least 14 proteins, including glycoproteins.[22]', 'Many mature females notice blood clots during menstruation. These appear as clumps of blood that may look like tissue. If there are questions (for example, was there a miscarriage?), examination under a microscope can confirm if it was endometrial tissue or pregnancy tissue (products of conception) that was shed.[23] Sometimes menstrual clots or shed endometrial tissue is incorrectly thought to indicate an early-term miscarriage of an embryo.

They also aimed to stimulate the establishment of various reform movements intended to address societal evils prior to the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Revival meetings provided an opportunity for individuals to experience emotional and spiritual transformation through personal salvation.

The movement began around 1790, gained momentum by 1800 and, after 1820, membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1850s. The Second Great Awakening reflected Romanticism characterized by enthusiasm, emotion, and an appeal to the super-natural. It rejected the skeptical rationalism and deism of the Enlightenment.', 'The revivals enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[1]', 'Historians named the Second Great Awakening in the context of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s and of the Third Great Awakening of the late 1850s to early 1900s. These revivals were part of a much larger Romantic religious movement that was sweeping across Europe at the time, mainly throughout England, Scotland, and Germany.[2]\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Spread of revivals\n1.1 Background\n1.2 Theology\n1.3 Burned-over district\n1.4 West and Tidewater South\n1.5 West\n1.6 Church membership soars\n2 Subgroups\n2.1 Adventism\n2.2 Holiness movement\n2.3 Restoration Movement\n3 Culture and society', 'Calvinism portal\nv\nt\ne\nBackground[edit]\nLike the First Great Awakening a half century earlier, the Second reflected Romanticism characterized by enthusiasm, emotion, and an appeal to the super-natural.[3] It rejected the skepticism, deism, and rationalism left over from the Enlightenment.[4] At about the same time, similar movements flourished in Europe. Pietism was sweeping German countries.[5] Evangelicalism was waxing strong in England.[6]', 'The Second Great Awakening occurred in several episodes and over different denominations; however, the revivals were very similar.[4] As the most effective form of evangelizing during this period, revival meetings cut across geographical boundaries,[7] and the movement quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers, known as circuit riders, who sought out people in remote frontier locations', ""These denominations were based on an interpretation of man's spiritual equality before God, which led them to recruit members and preachers from a wide range of classes and all races. Baptists and Methodist revivals were successful in some parts of the Tidewater in the South, where an increasing number of common planters, plain folk, and slaves were converted.\nWest[edit]\nMain article: Revival of 1800"", ""In the newly settled frontier regions, the revival was implemented through camp meetings. These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion, and they were important as social venues. The camp meeting was a religious service of several days' length with preachers. Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship. The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events"", "". The revivals followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis of the individual's sins and need to turn to Christ, restored by a sense of personal salvation. Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.[14] The Second Great Awakening marked a religious transition in society in America. Many Americans from the Calvinist sect emphasized man's inability to save themselves and that their only way to be saved was from grace from God.[15]"", 'The Revival of 1800 in Logan County, Kentucky, began as a traditional Presbyterian sacramental occasion. The first informal camp meeting began there in June, when people began camping on the grounds of the Red River Meeting House. Subsequent meetings followed at the nearby Gasper River and Muddy River congregations, all three under the ministry of James McGready. One year later, an even larger sacrament occasion was held at Cane Ridge, Kentucky under Barton Stone, attracting perhaps as many as 20,000 people. Numerous Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist ministers participated in the services']",evangelizing

52,disease of the light sensitive innermost layer of the eyeball,"Macular degeneration

This disease affects the light-sensitive innermost layer of the eyeball, the retina. No answer","['Early eyes[edit]\nThe basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein, surrounding the chromophore, a pigment that distinguishes colors. Groups of such cells are termed ""eyespots"", and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a very basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings.[22]', 'Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult, and only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species.[22]\nThe planarian has ""cup"" eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction.', 'Part of\nEye\nSystem\nVisual system\nArtery\nCentral retinal artery\nIdentifiers\nLatin\nRēte\nMeSH\nD012160\nTA\nA15.2.04.002\nFMA\n58301\nAnatomical terminology\n[edit on Wikidata]\nThe retina is the innermost, light-sensitive ""coat"", or layer, of shell tissue of the eye of most vertebrates and some molluscs. The optics of the eye create a focused two-dimentional image of the visual world on the retina, which translates that image into electrical neural impulses to the brain to create visual perception, the retina serving much the same function as film or a CCD in a camera.', 'The retina consists of several layers of neurons interconnected by synapses. The neural retina refers to the three layers of neural cells (photo receptor cells, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells) within the retina, which in its entirety comprises ten distinct layers, including an outer layer of pigmented epithelial cells. The only neural cells that are directly sensitive to light are the photoreceptor cells, which are of two types: rods and cones. Rods function mainly in dim light and provide black-and-white vision while cones are responsible for the perception of colour', 'In section, the retina is no more than 0.5\xa0mm thick. It has three layers of nerve cells and two of synapses, including the unique ribbon synapse. The optic nerve carries the ganglion cell axons to the brain, and the blood vessels that supply the retina. The ganglion cells lie innermost in the eye while the photoreceptive cells lie beyond. Because of this counter-intuitive arrangement, light must first pass through and around the ganglion cells and through the thickness of the retina, (including its capillary vessels, not shown) before reaching the rods and cones', '. Light is absorbed by the retinal pigment epithelium or the choroid (both of which are opaque).', 'The central retina predominantly contains cones, while the peripheral retina predominantly contains rods. In total, there are about seven million cones and a hundred million rods. At the centre of the macula is the foveal pit where the cones are narrow and long, and, arranged in a hexagonal mosaic, the most dense. At the foveal pit the other retinal layers are displaced, before building up along the foveal slope until the rim of the fovea, or parafovea, is reached, which is the thickest portion of the retina', '. The macula has a yellow pigmentation, from screening pigments, and is known as the macula lutea. The area directly surrounding the fovea has the highest density of rods converging on single bipolar cells. Since its cones have a much lesser convergence of signals, the fovea allows for the sharpest vision the eye can attain.[2]', ""Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia\nStomatitis nicotina\nTorus palatinus\n[show]\nOral mucosa – Lining of mouth\nAmalgam tattoo\nAngina bullosa haemorrhagica\nBehçet's disease\nBohn's nodules\nBurning mouth syndrome\nCandidiasis\nCondyloma acuminatum\nDarier's disease\nEpulis fissuratum\nErythema multiforme\nErythroplakia\nFibroma\nGiant-cell\nFocal epithelial hyperplasia\nFordyce spots\nHairy leukoplakia\nHand, foot and mouth disease\nHereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis\nHerpangina\nHerpes zoster\nIntraoral dental sinus\nLeukoedema\nLeukoplakia\nLichen planus\nLinea alba\nLupus erythematosus\nMelanocytic nevus"", ""Linea alba\nLupus erythematosus\nMelanocytic nevus\nMelanocytic oral lesion\nMolluscum contagiosum\nMorsicatio buccarum\nOral cancer\nBenign: Squamous cell papilloma\nKeratoacanthoma\nMalignant: Adenosquamous carcinoma\nBasaloid squamous carcinoma\nMucosal melanoma\nSpindle cell carcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma\nVerrucous carcinoma\nOral florid papillomatosis\nOral melanosis\nSmoker's melanosis\nPemphigoid\nBenign mucous membrane\nPemphigus\nPlasmoacanthoma\nStomatitis\nAphthous\nDenture-related\nHerpetic\nSmokeless tobacco keratosis\nSubmucous fibrosis\nUlceration\nRiga–Fede disease\nVerruca vulgaris""]",No answer

54,who said if a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it,"The phrase ""if a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it"" originates from a philosophical thought experiment, often attributed to George Berkeley in his work ""A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge"" (1710).

No single individual can be definitively credited with originating the exact phrase.","['If a tree falls in a forest - Wikipedia\n \nIf a tree falls in a forest \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nFor the 2011 documentary, see If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front.\nA fallen tree in a forest\n""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" is a philosophical thought experiment that raises questions regarding observation and perception.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 History\n2 Metaphysics\n2.1 The possibility of unperceived existence\n2.2 Knowledge of the unobserved world', ""2.2 Knowledge of the unobserved world\n2.3 The dissimilarity between sensation and reality\n2.4 Buddhist perspectives\n2.4.1 Tibetan\n2.4.2 Zen\n2.4.2.1 Hui-neng's Flag\n2.4.2.2 Hui-neng Receives The Dharma\n2.5 Hinduism\n3 In popular culture\n4 See also\n5 References\nHistory[edit]"", 'Philosopher George Berkeley, in his work, A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710), proposes, ""But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park [...] and nobody by to perceive them.[1] [...] The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden [...] no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them.""[2] (It is worth noting that the quote from section 45 is arguably a statement of an objection to Berkeley\'s view, and not a proclamation of it', '.) Nevertheless, Berkeley never actually wrote about the question.[3]', 'Some years later, a similar question is posed. It is unknown whether the source of this question is Berkeley or not. In June 1883 in the magazine The Chautauquan, the question was put, ""If a tree were to fall on an island where there were no human beings would there be any sound?"" They then went on to answer the query with, ""No. Sound is the sensation excited in the ear when the air or other medium is set in motion.""[4] This seems to imply that the question is posed not from a philosophical viewpoint, but from a purely scientific one', '. The magazine Scientific American corroborated the technical aspect of this question, while leaving out the philosophic side, a year later when they asked the question slightly reworded, ""If a tree were to fall on an uninhabited island, would there be any sound?"" And gave a more technical answer, ""Sound is vibration, transmitted to our senses through the mechanism of the ear, and recognized as sound only at our nerve centers. The falling of the tree or any other disturbance will produce vibration of the air. If there be no ears to hear, there will be no sound.""[5]', ""Albert Einstein is reported to have asked his fellow physicist and friend Niels Bohr, one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, whether he realistically believed that 'the moon does not exist if nobody is looking at it.' To this Bohr replied that however hard he (Einstein) may try, he would not be able to prove that it does, thus giving the entire riddle the status of a kind of an infallible conjecture—one that cannot be either proved or disproved."", 'The current phrasing appears to have originated in the 1910 book Physics by Charles Riborg Mann and George Ransom Twiss. The question ""When a tree falls in a lonely forest, and no animal is near by to hear it, does it make a sound? Why?"" is posed along with many other questions to quiz readers on the contents of the chapter, and as such, is posed from a purely physical point of view.[6]\nMetaphysics[edit]\nThe possibility of unperceived existence[edit]\nMain article: George Berkeley', 'Can something exist without being perceived? – e.g. ""is sound only sound if a person hears it?"" The most immediate philosophical topic that the riddle introduces involves the existence of the tree (and the sound it produces) outside of human perception. If no one is around to see, hear, touch or smell the tree, how could it be said to exist? What is it to say that it exists when such an existence is unknown? Of course, from a scientific viewpoint, it exists.[7] It is human beings that are able to perceive it', 'The famous 20th century Tamil saint Sri Ramana Maharshi, also made numerous references to the world being only a concept in the mind.\n""The mind is like akasa (space). Just as there are the objects in the akasa, so there are thoughts in the mind. The akasa is the counterpart of the mind and objects are of thought. One cannot hope to measure the universe and study the phenomena. It is impossible. For the objects are mental creations...The universe is only an object created by the mind and has its being in the mind.""

This is often condensed to: ""The dose makes the poison"" or in Latin, ""Sola dosis facit venenum"". It means that a substance can produce the harmful effect associated with its toxic properties only if it reaches a susceptible biological system within the body in a high enough concentration (i.e., dose)', '.e., dose).[2]', 'The principle relies on the finding that all chemicals—even water and oxygen—can be toxic if too much is eaten, drunk, or absorbed. ""The toxicity of any particular chemical depends on many factors, including the extent to which it enters an individual’s body.""[3] This finding provides also the basis for public health standards, which specify maximum acceptable concentrations of various contaminants in food, public drinking water, and the environment.[3]', 'However, there is no linear relationship and also more to chemical toxicity than the acute effects caused by short-term exposure. Relatively low doses of contaminants in water, food, and environment can already have significant chronic effects if there is a long-term exposure.[3] Many pollutants, drugs, and natural substances adhere to this principle by causing different effects at different levels, which can as a result lead to health standards that are either too strong or too weak.[4]', 'Generally the effects of different doses can be very different at different levels (not only bigger and smaller impacts depending on dose). Very low doses of some compounds can even induce stronger toxic responses than much higher doses as well as just different impacts.[3]\nToxic substances and the law[edit]', 'Toxic substances and the law[edit]\n""Regulators must extrapolate results not only from animal toxicity studies, typically from mice and/or rats to humans, but also from the very high doses usually used in animal experiments to the very low doses that are characteristic of human exposure.

The driver can put the transfer case into either ""two-wheel-drive"" or ""four-wheel-drive"" mode. This is sometimes accomplished by means of a shifter, similar to that in a manual transmission. On some vehicles this may be electronically operated by a switch instead', '. Some vehicles, such as all-wheel-drive sports cars, have transfer cases that are not selectable. Such a transfer case is permanently ""locked"" into all-wheel-drive mode.', 'Transfer cases that are designed to allow for normal road use synchronize the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels,[1] in much the same way the differential acts on a given axle. This is necessary because the front and rear tires never turn at the same speed. Different rates of tire rotation are generally due to different tire diameters (since front and rear tires inevitably wear at different rates) and different gear ratios in the front and rear differentials since manufacturers will often have a slightly lower ratio in the front vs', '. the rear to help with control (such as a 3.55:1 in the rear differential and a 3.54:1 in the front differential). If the transfer case did not make up the difference between the two different rates of rotation, binding would occur and the transfer case could become damaged.

Low range gears allow the vehicle to drive at much slower speeds while still operating within the usable power band / RPM range of the engine. This also increases the torque available at the axles.

In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats.', 'The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of haemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy. Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Structure\n1.1 Microanatomy\n1.2 Variation\n1.3 Development\n2 Function', '1.2 Variation\n1.3 Development\n2 Function\n3 Clinical significance\n3.1 Gallstones\n3.2 Inflammation\n3.3 Gallbladder removal\n3.4 Cancer\n3.5 Tests\n4 Society and culture\n5 Other animals\n6 History\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\nStructure[edit]', '8 References\n9 External links\nStructure[edit]\nThe gallbladder is a hollow organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the liver, that is grey-blue in life.[2] In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and 4 centimetres (1.6\xa0in) in diameter when fully distended.[3] The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces).[2]', 'The gallbladder is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct.[4] The gallbladder is divided into three sections: the fundus, body, and neck. The fundus is the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree.[2] The gallbladder fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V', '.[5] The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct. At the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct, there is an out-pouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as ""Hartmann\'s pouch"".[2]', 'Function[edit]\n1. Bile ducts: 2. Intrahepatic bile ducts, 3. Left and right hepatic ducts, 4. Common hepatic duct, 5. Cystic duct, 6. Common bile duct, 7. Ampulla of Vater, 8. Major duodenal papilla\n9. Gallbladder, 10–11. Right and left lobes of liver. 12. Spleen.\n13. Esophagus. 14. Stomach. 15. Pancreas: 16. Accessory pancreatic duct, 17. Pancreatic duct.\n18. Small intestine: 19. Duodenum, 20. Jejunum\n21–22. Right and left kidneys.\nThe front border of the liver has been lifted up (brown arrow).[14]', 'The main purpose of the gallbladder is to store bile, also called gall, needed for the digestion of fats in food. Produced by the liver, bile flows through small vessels into the larger hepatic ducts and ultimately though the cystic duct (parts of the biliary tree) into the gallbladder, where it is stored. At any one time, 30 to 60 millilitres (1.0 to 2.0\xa0US\xa0fl\xa0oz) of bile is stored within the gallbladder.[15]', 'Gallbladder[edit]\nThe gallbladder is a hollow part of the biliary tract that sits just beneath the liver, with the gallbladder body resting in a small depression.[23] It is a small organ where the bile produced by the liver is stored, before being released into the small intestine. Bile flows from the liver through the bile ducts and into the gall bladder for storage. The bile is released in response to cholecystokinin (CCK) a peptide hormone released from the duodenum. The production of CCK (by endocrine cells of the duodenum) is stimulated by the presence of fat in the duodenum.[24]', ""It is divided into three sections, a fundus, body and neck. The neck tapers and connects to the biliary tract via the cystic duct, which then joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. At this junction is a mucosal fold called Hartmann's pouch, where gallstones commonly get stuck. The muscular layer of the body is of smooth muscle tissue that helps the gallbladder contract, so that it can discharge its bile into the bile duct. The gallbladder needs to store bile in a natural, semi-liquid form at all times""]",beneath the liver

80,what is the first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis,The first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis is the absorption of light energy by proteins called reaction centers containing green chlorophyll pigments.,"['Photosynthesis - Wikipedia\n \nPhotosynthesis \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nSchematic of photosynthesis in plants. The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant.\nOverall equation for the type of photosynthesis that occurs in plants\nComposite image showing the global distribution of photosynthesis, including both oceanic phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation. Dark red and blue-green indicate regions of high photosynthetic activity in the ocean and on land, respectively.', 'Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms\' activities (energy transformation). This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek φῶς, phōs, ""light"", and σύνθεσις, synthesis, ""putting together"".[1][2][3] In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product', "". Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.[4]"", 'Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas', '. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that act as an immediate energy storage means: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the ""energy currency"" of cells.', 'In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, long-term energy storage in the form of sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle; some bacteria use different mechanisms, such as the reverse Krebs cycle, to achieve the same end. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).[5] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose.', 'The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons.[6] Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth,[7] which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130\xa0terawatts,[8][9][10] which is about three times the current power consumption of human civilization', 'The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelius van Niel is therefore:[14]\nCO2 + 2H2A + photons → [\u200bCH2O\u200b] + 2A + H2O\ncarbon dioxide + electron donor + light energy → carbohydrate + oxidized electron donor + water\nSince water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is:\nCO2 + 2H2O + photons → [CH2O] + O2 + H2O\ncarbon dioxide + water + light energy → carbohydrate + oxygen + water', 'This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation:\nCO2 + H2O + photons → [CH2O] + O2\ncarbon dioxide + water + light energy → carbohydrate + oxygen\nOther processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate:[15] The equation for this reaction is:\nCO2 + (AsO3−\n3) + photons → (AsO3−\n4) + CO[16]', 'CO2 + (AsO3−\n3) + photons → (AsO3−\n4) + CO[16]\ncarbon dioxide + arsenite + light energy → arsenate + carbon monoxide (used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.', 'Most organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far-red radiation.[17]']",one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron

85,which mode is used for short wave broadcast service,Amplitude modulation is the most commonly used type of modulation for shortwave broadcasting.,"['Shortwave radio - Wikipedia\n \nShortwave radio \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\n""Shortwave"" redirects here. For other uses, see Shortwave (disambiguation).\nGrundig Satellit 400 solid-state, digital shortwave receiver, circa 1986 [1]', 'Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave radio frequencies. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), and generally extends from 1.7–30\xa0MHz (176.3–10.0\xa0m); from the high end of the medium frequency band (MF) just above the mediumwave AM broadcast band, to the end of the HF band.', 'Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon. This is called skywave or ""skip"" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about 40 miles (64\xa0km)', '. Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. It is also used for military over-the-horizon radar, diplomatic communication, and two-way international communication by amateur radio enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes, as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications.', 'Solar flares produce a large increase in D region ionization so high, sometimes for periods of several minutes, all skywave propagation is nonexistent.\nTypes of modulation[edit]\nFurther information: Modulation\nNational Panasonic R3000 analog shortwave receiver, circa 1965 [20]\nSeveral different types of modulation are used to impress information on a short-wave transmission.', 'Amplitude modulation is the simplest type and the most commonly used for shortwave broadcasting. The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal (speech, or music, for example). At the receiver, a simple detector recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier.', 'Continuous wave (CW) is on-and-off keying of a carrier, used for Morse code communications and Hellschreiber facsimile-based teleprinter transmissions.[21]\nNarrow-band frequency modulation (NBFM) is used typically above 20\xa0MHz. Because of the larger bandwidth required, NBFM is commonly used for VHF communication. Regulations limit the bandwidth of a signal transmitted in the HF bands, and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth. NBFM is limited to short-range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere.[22]', ""Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) is a digital modulation for use on bands below 30\xa0MHz.\nRadioteletype, fax, digital, slow-scan television and other systems use forms of frequency-shift keying or audio subcarriers on a shortwave carrier. These generally require special equipment to decode, such as software on a computer equipped with a sound card.\nUsers[edit]\nPortable shortwave receiver's digital display tuned to the 75 meter band\nSome established users of the shortwave radio bands may include:"", 'The new digital audio broadcasting format for shortwave DRM operates 10\xa0kHz or 20\xa0kHz channels. There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM, as it mainly transmitted in 10\xa0kHz format.\nThe power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and over-the-horizon radar. Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized antenna designs (like the ALLISS antenna technology) to concentrate radio energy at the target area.', 'Advantages[edit]\nSoviet shortwave listener in Borisoglebsk, 1941\nShortwave does possess a number of advantages over newer technologies, including the following:']",MFSK

For transport in animals, see Circulatory system.', 'Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue, formed of more than one cell type, found in vascular plants. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant.', 'The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes. The individual cells of phloem are connected end-to-end, just as the sections of a pipe might be. As the plant grows, new vascular tissue differentiates in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant', '. The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles. These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells. In stems and roots, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem. In the stems of some Asterales dicots, there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well.', 'In leaves, the vascular bundles are located among the spongy mesophyll. The xylem is oriented toward the adaxial surface of the leaf (usually the upper side), and phloem is oriented toward the abaxial surface of the leaf. This is why aphids are typically found on the underside of the leaves rather than on the top, since the phloem transports sugars manufactured by the plant and they are closer to the lower surface.[citation needed]\nSee also[edit]\nXylem\nPhloem\nCork cambium\nVascular cambium\nVascular plant\nStele (biology)\nCirculatory system\nExternal links[edit]', 'Circulatory system\nExternal links[edit]\nIntro to Plant Structure Contains diagrams of the plant tissues, listed as an outline.\n[show]\nv\nt\ne\nBiological tissues\nAnimals\nEpithelial\nConnective\nMuscular\nNervous\nPlants\nDermal tissue\nEpidermis: Cuticle\nPavement cell\nGuard cell\nSubsidiary cell\nPeriderm: Phellem\nPhelloderm\nVascular tissue\nPhloem: Sieve tube\nCompanion cell\nPhloem fiber\nPhloem parenchyma\nXylem: Tracheid\nVessel element\nXylem fiber\nXylem parenchyma\nGround tissue\nParenchyma: Chlorenchyma\nAerenchyma\nCollenchyma\nSclerenchyma: Sclereid\nFiber\nMeristematic tissue\nPrimary: Protoderm\nProcambium', 'Meristematic tissue\nPrimary: Protoderm\nProcambium\nGround meristem\nSecondary: Cork cambium\nVascular cambium\n[show]\nv\nt\ne\nBotany\nHistory of botany\nSubdisciplines\nPlant systematics\nEthnobotany\nPaleobotany\nPlant anatomy\nPlant ecology\nPhytogeography\nGeobotany\nFlora\nPhytochemistry\nPlant pathology\nBryology\nPhycology\nFloristics\nDendrology\nPlant groups\nAlgae\nArchaeplastida\nBryophyte\nNon-vascular plants\nVascular plants\nSpermatophytes\nPteridophyte\nGymnosperm\nAngiosperm\nPlant morphology\n(glossary)\nPlant cells\nCell wall\nPhragmoplast\nPlastid\nPlasmodesma\nVacuole\nTissues\nMeristem\nVascular tissue', 'Vacuole\nTissues\nMeristem\nVascular tissue\nVascular bundle\nGround tissue\nMesophyll\nCork\nWood\nStorage organs\nVegetative\nRoot\nRhizoid\nBulb\nRhizome\nShoot\nStem\nLeaf\nPetiole\nCataphyll\nBud\nSessility\nReproductive\n(Flower)\nFlower development\nInflorescence\nUmbel\nRaceme\nBract\nPedicellate\nFlower\nWhorl\nFloral symmetry\nFloral diagram\nFloral formula\nReceptacle\nHypanthium (Floral cup)\nPerianth\nTepal\nPetal\nSepal\nSporophyll\nGynoecium\nOvary\nOvule\nStigma\nArchegonium\nAndroecium\nStamen\nStaminode\nPollen\nTapetum\nGynandrium\nGametophyte\nSporophyte\nPlant embryo\nFruit\nFruit anatomy\nBerry\nCapsule\nSeed\nSeed dispersal', 'Stem usually consist of three tissues, dermal tissue, ground tissue and vascular tissue.

While Bonnie and Clyde attempt to disintegrate the weakened economic and social landscape of the 1930s, Mickey and Mallory try to free America from the overarching conventions which influence the common masses, primarily the media.

97,when did they stop making pull tabs on beer cans,Push-tabs stopped being widely used in the mid-1970s when they were replaced by stay-on-tabs. No specific year is mentioned for the complete cessation of pull tabs.,"['In 1959, Ermal Fraze devised a can-opening method that would come to dominate the canned beverage market. His invention was the ""pull-tab"". This eliminated the need for a separate opener tool by attaching an aluminium pull-ring lever with a rivet to a pre-scored wedge-shaped tab section of the can top. The ring was riveted to the center of the top, which created an elongated opening large enough that one hole simultaneously served to let the beverage flow out while air flowed in. In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr', '. In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr. Fraze had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he later stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab.[4] Pull-tab cans, or the discarded tabs from them, were also called ""pop-tops"" colloquially. In Australia these were colloquially known as ""ring-pull""', '. Into the 1970s, the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with a significant problem, as people would frequently discard the pull-tabs on the ground as litter, or drop them into the can and risk choking on them. These problems were both addressed by the invention of the ""push-tab"". Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up', "". It needed no ring to pull up. Instead, the raised aluminium blister was pushed down into the can, with a small unscored piece that kept the tab connected after being pushed inside. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person's finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening"", 'Beer can pop-top display at a Budweiser Brewery\nEarly metal beverage cans had no tabs; they were opened by a can-piercer or churchkey, a device resembling a bottle opener with a sharp point. The can was opened by punching two triangular holes in the lid—a large one for drinking, and a second (smaller) one to admit air.\nAs early as 1922, inventors were applying for patents on cans with tab tops, but the technology of the time made these inventions impractical.[14] Later advancements saw the ends of the can made out of aluminium instead of steel.', 'Cans are usually in sealed paperboard cartons, corrugated fiberboard boxes, or trays covered with plastic film. The entire distribution system and packaging need to be controlled to ensure freshness.[15]\nPop-tab[edit]\nOld style pull-tab in use on a can of Tsingtao beer in Beijing, China in 2009', 'Mikolaj Kondakow and James Wong of Thunder Bay,[dubious – discuss] Ontario, Canada invented the pull tab version for bottles in or before 1951 (Canadian patent 476789).[16] Then, in 1962, Ermal Cleon Fraze (1913–1989)[17] of Dayton, Ohio, United States, invented the similar integral rivet and pull-tab version (also known as ring pull in British English), which had a ring attached at the rivet for pulling, and which would come off completely to be discarded. He received US Patent No', '. He received US Patent No. 3,349,949 for his pull-top can design in 1963 and licensed his invention to Alcoa and Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the latter of which first introduced the design on Iron City Beer cans.

In 1976 the Journal of the American Medical Association noted cases of children ingesting pull-tabs that had broken off and dropped into the can.[18]\nFull-top pull-tabs were also used in some oil cans and are currently used in some soup, pet food, tennis ball, nuts and other cans.\nStay-on-tab[edit]\nA ""standard"" size can opening, once common in American soft drinks.', 'In 1975, Daniel F.

In the years since, it has become an enduring classic. It was the most played song in the last 75 years in public places in the UK (as of 2009),[7] and the United Kingdom performing rights group Phonographic Performance Limited in 2004 recognised it as the most-played record by British broadcasting of the past 70 years', '.[8] Also in 2004, Rolling Stone placed ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" 57th on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.', 'Structurally and thematically, the song is unusual in many respects. While the recorded version is 4:03 long, it is composed of only two verses, each with chorus. The piece is also more instrument-driven than most songs of the period, and with a much looser rhyme scheme. Its unusually allusive and referential lyrics are much more complex than most lyrics of the time (for example, the chorus focuses on Chaucer\'s ""The Miller\'s Tale""). Thus, this piece can be considered an early example of progressive rock.[citation needed]', 'The phrase a whiter shade of pale has since gained widespread use in the English language, noticed by several dictionaries.[20][21][22] As such, the phrase is today often used in contexts independent of any consideration of the song.[23] It has also been heavily paraphrased, in forms like ""an Xer shade of Y"", to the extent that it has been recognised as a snowclone[24][25] – a type of cliché and phrasal template.\nComposition[edit]\nThe song\'s distinctive, Bach-inspired organ part was played on a Hammond M102.', 'In the United States, the single reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 1 million copies. It also peaked at number 22 on the soul charts there.[33] In the Netherlands, the song entered the chart at number 1 in June 1967 and again reached number 1 in July 1972.

108,my first love was a castle in the sky,No answer,"[""Fitzgerald's visits to Long Island's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby's setting. Today, there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party.[7] Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale)"", '. Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success', "".[8] Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich.[8] In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.[8]"", 'The film (and subsequent novel) were memoirs written by Herman Raucher; they detailed the events in his life over the course of the summer he spent on Nantucket Island in 1942 when he was fourteen years old.[3] Originally, the film was meant to be a tribute to his friend Oscar ""Oscy"" Seltzer, an Army medic killed in the Korean War.[3][6] Seltzer was shot dead on a battlefield in Korea whilst attending to a wounded man; this happened on Raucher\'s birthday, and consequently, Raucher has not celebrated a birthday since', '. During the course of writing the screenplay, Raucher came to the realization that despite growing up with Oscy and having bonded with him through their formative years, the two had never really had any meaningful conversations or gotten to know one another on a more personal level.[3]', 'Instead, Raucher decided to focus on the first major adult experience of his life, that of falling in love for the first time. The woman (named Dorothy, like her screen counterpart) was a fellow vacationer on the island whom the 14-year old Raucher had befriended one day when he helped her carry groceries home; he became a friend of her and her husband and helped her with chores after her husband was called to fight in World War II', ""In a talk given to a group of schoolteachers, Wilson Rawls related how he wrote the first version of the novel (along with five full novels, and hundreds of short stories and novelettes) during the years that he worked on construction in Mexico and Idaho.

When he met his fiancée, Sophie, he did not want her to know about his failed dreams of becoming a writer, so about a week before he got married he visited his parents and burned all his manuscripts.

He went to work on lengthening the manuscript. He wrote it longhand with no punctuation.

Sophie then sent the manuscript to the Ladies' Home Journal. She believed that a woman editor at the Ladies' Home Journal would like the story.

Alexander Hamilton proclaimed that no ""Citizen of the United States should refrain from turkey on Thanksgiving Day,"" and Benjamin Franklin had high regard for the wild turkey as an American icon,[6] but turkey was uncommon as Thanksgiving fare until after 1800.

French drip coffee, cigars and cigarettes.[8]', 'Non-traditional foods other than turkey are sometimes served as the main dish for a Thanksgiving dinner. Ham is often served alongside turkey in many non-traditional households. Goose and duck, foods which were traditional European centerpieces of Christmas dinners before being displaced, are now sometimes served in place of the Thanksgiving turkey. Sometimes, fowl native to the region where the meal is taking place is used; for example, an article in Texas Monthly magazine suggested quail as the main dish for a Texan Thanksgiving feast', '. John Madden, who appeared on television for the NFL Thanksgiving Day game from 1981 to 2001, frequently advocated his fondness for the turducken, deboned turkey, duck and chicken nested inside each other then cooked.[13] In a few areas of the West Coast of the United States, Dungeness crab is common as an alternate main dish, as crab season starts in early November. Similarly, Thanksgiving falls within deer hunting season in the Northeastern United States, which encourages the use of venison as a centerpiece', '. Vegetarians or vegans may have a tofu, wheat gluten or lentil-based substitute; or stuffed squash. In Alaskan villages, whale meat is sometimes eaten.[14]Irish immigrants have been known to have prime rib of beef as their centerpiece since beef in Ireland was once a rarity; families would save up money for this dish to signify newfound prosperity and hope.', 'In the United States, a globalist approach to Thanksgiving has become common with the impact of immigration.

The series premiered on Nick Jr. August 20, 2007 and ended on November 12, 2015. There is a single topic in each episode, e.g. ""Adventure"", ""Friends"", and ""Dance"", through songs and short storylines in the half-hour program. Additionally, the show teaches children life and social skills, such as sharing and trying new foods. It also encourages viewers to move along with and dance with the characters in the program', '. The show is noted for its indie-culture guest stars and bands, and for drawing visual inspiration from 8-bit video games and H.R. Pufnstuf, among other television shows. Created by Christian Jacobs (lead singer of the Aquabats) and Scott Schultz, the show is written to appeal to children and their parents. The television program has spawned a touring live stage show, various toys and branded clothing. Trademarks relating to Yo Gabba Gabba! and its characters are held by GabbaCaDabra, LLC. in partnership with The Magic Store and WildBrain.', ""Yo Gabba Gabba! was developed by two Southern California fathers, Christian Jacobs and Scott Schultz, who first started working together as teenagers, producing and directing skateboarding videos. Their goal was to design a kids' show that was entertaining while featuring real artists and real performers.

Pacific Institute, an Oakland-based environmental think tank, was warning that the lack of replenishment water was leading to a ""period of very rapid deterioration.""[33] The rapidly shrinking sea was a ""looming environmental and public health crisis""[31] With the increased shrinkage, dust storms would increase and a rotten-egg smell could reach to the coastal cities.[33]', ""In 2018, California's Natural Resources Agency received 11 proposals to increase waterflow to the sea in order to reduce dust and dust-borne toxins.

A disputed Himalayan border was the main pretext for war, but other issues played a role. There had been a series of violent border incidents after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India had granted asylum to the Dalai Lama', '.

The Indian Intelligence Bureau received information about a Chinese buildup along the border which could be a precursor to war.[56]', 'During June–July 1962, Indian military planners began advocating ""probing actions"" against the Chinese, and accordingly, moved mountain troops forward to cut off Chinese supply lines.

Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness).[2] Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth.[2][4] The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied', '.[2][4] There is not usually any bleeding.[7] Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin.[4] If Staphylococcus aureus is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts.[8] In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue.[2][4]', '. Potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended by some to help distinguish between the harmless and the pathogenic forms, and thereby highlight which cases of angular cheilitis are truly caused by Candida.[2] The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing.', 'A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. This is herpes labialis (a cold sore), and is sometimes termed ""angular herpes simplex"".[2] A cold sore at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips, and follows a pattern of vesicle (blister) formation followed by rupture leaving a crusted sore which resolves in about 7–10 days, and recurs in the same spot periodically, especially during periods of stress', '.[2] The term ""cheilocandidiasis"" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking.[14] Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Individuals may lick their lips in an attempt to provide a temporary moment of relief, only serving to worsen the condition.[17]', 'The sunscreen in some types of lip balm degrades over time into an irritant. Using expired lipbalm can initiate mild angular cheilitis, and when the person applies more lipbalm to alleviate the cracking, it only aggravates it. Because of the delayed onset of contact dermatitis and the recovery period lasting days to weeks, people typically do not make the connection between the causative agent and the symptoms.[medical citation needed]\nNutritional deficiencies[edit]', "". Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC.[5] Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC"", "".[5] This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis.[4] In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth""]",infection
118,the primary reason for the creation of federal whistleblower statutes was to,"To create federal whistleblower statutes, the primary goal was to protect federal employees who report agency misconduct, such as violations of laws, rules, regulations, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuses of authority, and dangers to public health or safety. These statutes aim to prevent retaliatory actions against whistleblowers. (Source: Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989)","['The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub.L. 101-12 as amended, is a United States federal law that protects federal whistleblowers who work for the government and report agency misconduct. A federal agency violates the Whistleblower Protection Act if agency authorities take (or threaten to take) retaliatory personnel action against any employee or applicant because of disclosure of information by that employee or applicant', '. Whistleblowers[1] may file complaints that they believe reasonably evidences a violation of a law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.', 'Contents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Authorized Federal Agencies\n2 Legal Cases\n3 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act and Presidential Policy Directive 19\n4 Related legislation\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nAuthorized Federal Agencies[edit]', ""The Office of Special Counsel investigates federal whistleblower complaints. In October 2008, then-special counsel Scott Bloch resigned amid an FBI investigation into whether he obstructed justice by illegally deleting computer files following complaints that he had retaliated against employees who disagreed with his policies. Then-Senator Barack Obama made a campaign vow to appoint a special counsel committed to whistleblower rights. It was not until April 2011 that President Obama's appointee Carolyn Lerner was confirmed by the Senate"", '. Today, the primary mission of OSC is to safeguard the merit system by protecting federal employees and applicants from prohibited personnel practices, especially reprisal for whistleblowing.', ""The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was established under Article III of the Constitution on October 1, 1982. It is the only court empowered to hear appeals of whistleblower cases decided by the merit board, has been criticized by Senator Grassley (R-Iowa) and others in Congress for misinterpreting whistleblower laws and setting a precedent that is hostile to claimants. Between 1994 and 2010, the court had ruled for whistleblowers in only three of 203 cases decided on their merits, GAP's analysis found.[2]\nLegal Cases[edit]"", ""The U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Garcetti v. Ceballos, 04-473, ruled in 2006 that government employees do not have protection from retaliation by their employers under the First Amendment of the Constitution when they speak pursuant to their official job duties.[3] The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) uses agency lawyers in the place of administrative law judges to decide federal employees' whistleblower appeals"", 'President Barack Obama issued Presidential Policy Directive 19 (PPD-19), entitled ""Protecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information"". According to the law signed by Obama on October 10, 2012, it is written that ""this Presidential Policy Directive ensures that employees (1) serving in the Intelligence Community or (2) who are eligible for access to classified information can effectively report waste, fraud, and abuse while protecting classified national security information. It prohibits retaliation against employees for reporting waste, fraud, and abuse.[7]', 'However, according to a report that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs submitted to accompany S. 743, ""the federal whistleblowers have seen their protections diminish in recent years, largely as a result of a series of decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction over many cases brought under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). Specifically, the Federal Circuit has wrongly accorded a narrow definition to the type of disclosure that qualifies for whistleblower protection', '. Additionally, the lack of remedies under current law for most whistleblowers in the intelligence community and for whistleblowers who face retaliation in the form of withdrawal of the employee\'s security clearance leaves unprotected those who are in a position to disclose wrongdoing that directly affects our national security.""[8] S', '.""[8] S. 743 would address these problems by restoring the original congressional intent of the WPA to adequately protect whistleblowers, by strengthening the WPA, and by creating new whistleblower protections for intelligence employees and new protections for employees whose security clearance is withdrawn in retaliation for having made legitimate whistleblower disclosures.[9] S. 743 ultimately became Pub.L. 112-199 (S.Rep. 112-155).']",No answer

Contrary to popular belief, however, the speech was not given at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, California as a nomination speech for presidential candidate Senator Barry Goldwater; Richard Nixon gave that nomination speech. Reagan, though he campaigned for Goldwater, did not use ""A Time for Choosing"" until October 27, 1964, when it was part of a pre-recorded television program, Rendezvous with Destiny', '. In his autobiography, An American Life, Reagan recalled going to bed that night ""hoping I hadn\'t let Barry down.""[1]', 'Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. In the speech, he revealed his ideological motivation: ""The Founding Fathers knew a government can\'t control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.""[2] He also said, ""You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right.

The crown-of-thorns starfish receives its name from venomous thorn-like spines that cover its upper surface, resembling the biblical crown of thorns. It is one of the largest starfish in the world.', 'The body form of the crown-of-thorns starfish is fundamentally the same as that of a typical starfish, with a central disk and radiating arms. Its special traits, however, include being disc-shaped, multiple-armed, flexible, prehensile, and heavily spined, and having a large ratio of stomach surface to body mass.[1] Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous tube feet that extend to the tip of each arm. In being multiple-armed, it has lost the five-fold symmetry (pentamerism) typical of starfish, although it begins its life cycle with this symmetry.', 'Adult crown-of-thorns starfish normally range in size from 25 to 35\xa0cm (9.8 to 13.8\xa0in).[2] They have up to 21 arms.[3] Although the body of the crown of thorns has a stiff appearance, it is able to bend and twist to fit around the contours of the corals on which it feeds. The underside of each arm has a series of closely fitting plates which form a groove and extend in rows to the mouth.[4] They are usually of subdued colours, pale brown to grey-green, but they may be garish with bright warning colours in some parts of their wide range.[1][5]', 'Acanthaster planci has a long history in the scientific literature with great confusion in the generic and species names from the outset, with a long list of complex synonyms.[8] As a very distinctive starfish, it is not surprising that it was first described in 1705. Rhumphius used the name Stella marina quindecium radiotorum. Later, Linnaeus described it as Asterias planci, based on an illustration by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743), when he introduced his system of binomial nomenclature. No type specimens are known; the specimen described by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743) is no longer extant.', 'Subsequent generic names used for the crown-of-thorns starfish included Stellonia, Echinaster and Echinites, before settling on Acanthaster (Gervais 1841). Species names included echintes, solaris, mauritensis, ellisii, and ellisii pseudoplanci (with subspecies). Most of these names arose from confusion in the historical literature, but Acanthaster ellisii came to be used for the distinctive starfish in the eastern Pacific Gulf of California.', 'In coral reefs in the Philippines, female specimens were found with a gonadosomatic index (ratio of gonad mass to body mass) as high as 22%,[38] which underlines the high fecundity of this starfish. Babcock et al. (1993)[39] monitored changes in fecundity and fertility (fertilisation rate) over the spawning season of the Crown-of-thorns starfish on Davies Reef, central Great Barrier Reef, from 1990 to 1992. The starfish were observed to spawn (photograph) from December to January (early to mid-summer) in this region with most observations being in January', '. However, both gonadosomatic index and fertility peaked early and declined to low levels by late January, indicating that most successful reproductive events took place early in the spawning season. In northern hemisphere coral reefs however, crown-of-thorns populations reproduce in April and May,[38] and were also observed spawning in the Gulf of Thailand in September.[40] High rates of egg fertilisation may be achieved through the behaviour of proximate and synchronised spawning (see above in Behaviour).', ""Recent information on crown-of-thorns starfish on Australia's Great Barrier Reef\nControlling crown-of-thorns starfish\nCrown-of-thorn outbreak simulation\nMicrodocs: Crown-of-thorns\nAcanthaster planci expedition 1969 to Eastern Caroline Islands\nAn infographic relating to the crown-of-thorns starfish in the Great Barrier Reef\nCrown of Thorns starfish 1971 Fathom magazine (Australia)\nTaxon identifiers\nWd: Q26634\nADW: Acanthaster_planci\nARKive: acanthaster-planci\nBioLib: 422188\nEoL: 598484\nFossilworks: 100993\nGBIF: 2271208\niNaturalist: 50915\nITIS: 157194\nNCBI: 133434\nWoRMS: 213289"", 'ITIS: 157194\nNCBI: 133434\nWoRMS: 213289\nAuthority control\nNDL: 01030270\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetrieved from ""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crown-of-thorns_starfish&oldid=814983736""']","perhaps most common in Australia, but can occur at tropical and subtropical latitudes from the Red Sea and the east African coast across the Indian Ocean, and across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of Central America"

Set in Denmark, the play dramatises the revenge Prince Hamlet is called to wreak upon his uncle, Claudius, by the ghost of Hamlet's father, King Hamlet. Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the throne, also marrying his deceased brother's widow."", 'Hamlet is Shakespeare\'s longest play, and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature, with a story capable of ""seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others"".[1] It was probably one of Shakespeare\'s most popular works during his lifetime,[2] and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879', '.[3] It has inspired many other writers—from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch—and has been described as ""the world\'s most filmed story after Cinderella"".[4]', ""The story of Shakespeare's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have. He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time"", 'Date[edit]\nJohn Barrymore as Hamlet (1922)\n""Any dating of Hamlet must be tentative"", cautions the New Cambridge editor, Phillip Edwards.[d] The earliest date estimate relies on Hamlet\'s frequent allusions to Shakespeare\'s Julius Caesar, itself dated to mid-1599.[40][41] The latest date estimate is based on an entry, of 26 July 1602, in the Register of the Stationers\' Company, indicating that Hamlet was ""latelie Acted by the Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes"".', 'In 1598, Francis Meres published his Palladis Tamia, a survey of English literature from Chaucer to its present day, within which twelve of Shakespeare\'s plays are named. Hamlet is not among them, suggesting that it had not yet been written. As Hamlet was very popular, Bernard Lott, the series editor of New Swan, believes it ""unlikely that he [Meres] would have overlooked ... so significant a piece"".[38]', ""Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range.[136][137][p] Judging by the number of reprints, Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only Henry IV Part 1, Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it.[2] Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.[141]"", ""Firm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant. What is known is that the crew of the ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607;[142][143][144] that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death;[144] and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637"", 'The best-known is Tom Stoppard\'s 1966 play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, which retells many of the events of the story from the point of view of the characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and gives them a backstory of their own. Several times since 1995, the American Shakespeare Center has mounted repertories that included both Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, with the same actors performing the same roles in each; in their 2001 and 2009 seasons the two plays were ""directed, designed, and rehearsed together to make the most out of the shared scenes and situations"".[233]', ""W. S. Gilbert wrote a short comic play titled Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, in which Hamlet's play is presented as a tragedy written by Claudius in his youth of which he is greatly embarrassed. Through the chaos triggered by Hamlet's staging of it, Guildenstern helps Rosencrantz vie with Hamlet to make Ophelia his bride.[234]""]","almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage"
134,where did the first african american air force unit train,"The first African American air force unit trained at Tuskegee Army Air Field, near Tuskegee, Alabama.","['All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Moton Field, the Tuskegee Army Air Field, and were educated at Tuskegee University, located near Tuskegee, Alabama. The group included five Haitians from the Haitian Air Force, and one pilot from Trinidad.[2]. It also included a Hispanic or Latino airman born in the Dominican Republic[3].', 'Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, they never served in combat. The 99th Pursuit Squadron (later, 99th Fighter Squadron) was the first black flying squadron, and the first to deploy overseas (to North Africa in April 1943, and later to Sicily and Italy). The 332nd Fighter Group, which originally included the 100th, 301st, and 302nd Fighter Squadrons, was the first black flying group. It deployed to Italy in early 1944', '.[7] In 1941, the War Department and the Army Air Corps, under pressure — three months before its transformation into the USAAF — constituted the first all-black flying unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron.[8]', 'Due to the restrictive nature of selection policies, the situation did not seem promising for African-Americans since, in 1940, the U.S. Census Bureau reported there were only 124 African-American pilots in the nation.[9] The exclusionary policies failed dramatically when the Air Corps received an abundance of applications from men who qualified, even under the restrictive requirements. Many of the applicants already had participated in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, unveiled in late December 1938 (CPTP). Tuskegee University had participated since 1939.[10]\nTesting[edit]', 'A cadre of 271 enlisted men was trained in aircraft ground support trades at Chanute, beginning in July 1941; the skills being taught were so technical that setting up segregated classes was deemed impossible. This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee and Maxwell Fields in Alabama.[15]', 'The Tuskegee program officially began June 1941 with the 99th Pursuit Squadron at Tuskegee University.[16][17][N 4] The unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men,[19] and was backed by an entire service arm. After primary training at Moton Field, they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field, about 10 miles (16\xa0km) to the west for conversion training onto operational types. Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location', 'Instrument certificate for Tuskegee Airman Robert M. Glass, signed by Parrish\nThe strict racial segregation the U.S. Army required gave way in the face of the requirements for complex training in technical vocations. Typical of the process was the development of separate African-American flight surgeons to support the operations and training of the Tuskegee Airmen.[27] Before the development of this unit, no U.S. Army flight surgeons had been black.', 'Training of African-American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses until 1943, when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field, Texas. This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army. Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941-49. At that time, the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years. Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy', 'The home field for the 477th was Selfridge Field, located outside Detroit, however, other bases would be used for various types of training courses. Twin-engine pilot training began at Tuskegee while transition to multi-engine pilot training was at Mather Field, California. Some ground crews trained at Mather before rotating to Inglewood. Gunners learned to shoot at Eglin Field, Florida. Bombers-navigators learned their trades at Hondo Army Air Field and Midland Air Field, Texas or at Roswell, New Mexico', '. Training of the new African-American crewmen also took place at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Scott Field, Belleville, Illinois. Once trained, the air and ground crews would be spliced into a working unit at Selfridge.[46][47]']","Moton Field, the Tuskegee Army Air Field"

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans,[1] as well as among church leaders and among women in general', '. Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican–American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British Intelligence. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for ""a war to end all wars"" that would ""make the world safe for democracy"", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.[4]', 'On December 7, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Austria-Hungary.[5][6]\nU.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Main issues\n1.1 Naval blockade\n1.1.1 The strategy behind the blockade\n1.2 Business considerations\n1.3 Views of the elites\n2 Public opinion\n2.1 Parties\n2.2 Workers, farmers, and African Americans\n2.3 South\n2.4 German Americans\n2.5 Christian churches and pacifists\n2.6 Jewish Americans\n2.7 Irish-Americans\n2.8 Pro-Allied immigrants\n2.9 Popular pacifism\n2.10 German agents\n3 Preparedness movement\n3.1 Size of military\n3.2 Navy', 'On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war.

In the House, the declaration passed 373 to 50, with Claude Kitchin, a senior Democrat, notably opposing it.

The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan,[20][21] and several days later, on December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940,[22] disappeared.[21]', 'There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, ""a date which will live in infamy"".

The Allied Powers, led by the British Empire, France, Russia until March 1918, Japan and the United States after 1917, defeated the Central Powers, led by the German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The war caused the disintegration of four empires—the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian ones—as well as radical change in the European and West Asian maps. The Allied powers before 1917 are referred to as the Triple Entente, and the Central Powers are referred to as the Triple Alliance.', 'Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the Western Front, within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by a ""No man\'s land"") running from the North Sea to the border of Switzerland.

It is one of the best known Arthurian stories, with its plot combining two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel,[1] it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition', ""The most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire.[12] He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem St. Erkenwald, which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to Gawain. St. Erkenwald, however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.[10]\nVerse form[edit]"", 'The 2,530 lines and 101 stanzas that make up Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are written in what linguists call the ""Alliterative Revival"" style typical of the 14th century. Instead of focusing on a metrical syllabic count and rhyme, the alliterative form of this period usually relied on the agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at the beginning of the line and another pair at the end. Each line always includes a pause, called a caesura, at some point after the first two stresses, dividing it into two half-lines', ""The poem has been adapted to film twice, on both occasions by writer-director Stephen Weeks: first as Gawain and the Green Knight in 1973 and again in 1984 as Sword of the Valiant: The Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, featuring Miles O'Keeffe as Gawain and Sean Connery as the Green Knight. Both films have been criticised for deviating from the poem's plot. Also, Bertilak and the Green Knight are never connected.[103] French/Australian director Martin Beilby directed a short (30') film adaptation in 2014"", '. There have been at least two television adaptations, Gawain and the Green Knight in 1991 and the animated Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in 2002. The BBC broadcast a documentary presented by Simon Armitage in which the journey depicted in the poem is traced, using what are believed to be the actual locations.[104]', 'Opera[edit]\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight was first adapted as an opera in 1978 by the composer Richard Blackford on commission from the village of Blewbury, Oxfordshire. The libretto was written for the adaptation by the children\'s novelist John Emlyn Edwards. The ""Opera in Six Scenes"" was subsequently recorded by Decca between March and June 1979 and released on the Argo label[111] in November 1979.', ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was adapted into an opera called Gawain by Harrison Birtwistle, first performed in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised for maintaining the complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form.[112] Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's Gwyneth and the Green Knight, first performed in 2002. This opera uses Sir Gawain as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight"", 'Jump up ^ ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"".

These glaciers follow the topography and flow down the mountain's valleys.[9] The uppermost glacier occupies Jacobsen Valley on the north face of Mount Vinson, and flows either into Branscomb Glacier to the west or Crosswell Glacier to the east. The Crosswell Glacier flows into the Rutford Ice Stream via Ellen Glacier"", '.[9] The south face of Mount Vinson is drained by Roché Glacier, which flows westwards into Branscomb Glacier, with the latter leaving Vinson Massif to join Nimitz Glacier.', ""History[edit]\nA high mountain, provisionally known as 'Vinson', was long suspected to be in this part of West Antarctica, but it was not actually seen until January 1958, when it was spotted by US Navy aircraft from Byrd Station.

If the sperm carried an X chromosome instead, the resulting zygote would be XX, leading to the development of a female individual. [1]","['Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century.[1]', 'The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum. The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation, follows with ovulation, and finishes with fertilization. Various exceptions to this sequence are possible, including artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, external ejaculation without copulation, or copulation shortly after ovulation.[2][3][4] Upon encountering the secondary oocyte, the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg', '. Gymnosperms produce multiple archegonia, which produce the female gamete. During pollination, pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from the pollen cone to the ovule. Pollen is usually moved by wind or insects. Whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle. The pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms', '. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat.[16]', 'Oogenesis\nGamete\nspermatozoon\novum\nFertilization\nExternal fertilization\nInternal fertilization\nSexual selection\nPlant reproduction\nFungal reproduction\nSexual reproduction in animals\nSexual intercourse\nCopulation\nHuman reproduction\nSexuality\nPlant sexuality\nAnimal sexuality\nHuman sexuality\nMechanics\nDifferentiation\nActivity\n Sex portal\n Biology portal\nv\nt\ne', 'A gamete (from Ancient Greek γαμετή gamete from gamein ""to marry""[1]) is a haploid cell that fuses with another haploid cell during fertilization (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum (or egg)—and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type—called a sperm. In short a gamete is an egg (female gamete) or a sperm (male gamete)', '. This is an example of anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell[2][3]). In contrast, isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for mating type. The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one ploidy of each type, and are created through meiosis.', 'Oogenesis is the process of female gamete formation in animals. This process involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary oocyte to produce the haploid ovum (gamete). Spermatogenesis is the process of male gamete formation in animals. This process also involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary spermatocyte to produce the haploid spermatozoon (gamete).\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Dissimilarity\n2 Sex determination in humans and birds\n3 Artificial gametes\n4 Plants\n5 Notes and references\nDissimilarity[edit]', 'In humans, a normal ovum can carry only an X chromosome (of the X and Y chromosomes), whereas a sperm may carry either an X or a Y (a non-normal ovum can end up carrying two or no X chromosomes, as a result of a irregularity at either of the two stages of meiosis, while a non-normal sperm cell can end up carrying either no sex-defining chromosomes, an XY pair, or XX pair as a result of the forementioned reason); ergo the male sperm can play a role in determining the sex of any resulting zygote, if the zygote has two X chromosomes it may develop into a female, if it has an X and a Y', 'may develop into a female, if it has an X and a Y chromosome, it may develop into a male']",No answer

Source: Context provided","['Agrilus planipennis, commonly known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area.

Silver flowed into the Ming dynasty in large amounts, estimated by Joseph Needham at 300 million taels, equivalent to over 190 billion dollars today. Additionally, the Ming imported European firearms to maintain modern weaponry. The liberalized economy facilitated trade and commerce through infrastructure improvements like canals, roads, and bridges.

It is regarded as one of China's three golden ages (the other two being the Han and Song periods). The period was marked by the increasing political influence of the merchants, the gradual weakening of imperial rule, and technological advances.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Currency\n2 Manufactures\n2.1 Privatization\n2.2 Emergence of wage labor\n3 Early encouragement of agriculture under Hongwu\n3.1 Emergence of commercial plantations\n3.2 Rural markets during the Ming"", 'In order to recover from rule of the Mongols and the wars that followed them, the Hongwu Emperor enacted pro-agricultural policies. The state invested extensively in agricultural canals, reduced taxes on agriculture to 1/30 of the output, and later to 1.5% of agricultural output. Ming farmers also introduced many innovations such as water-powered plows, and new agricultural methods such as crop rotation. This led to a massive agricultural surplus that became the basis of a market economy.[5]\nEmergence of commercial plantations[edit]', 'The Ming saw the rise of commercial plantations who produced crops suitable to their regions. Tea, fruits, paint and other goods were produced on a massive scale by these agricultural plantations. Regional patterns of production established during this period continued into the Qing dynasty.[5] The Columbian exchange brought crops such as corn with these foreign crops. During the Ming, specialized areas also popped up planting large numbers of cash crops that could be sold at markets. Large numbers of peasants abandoned the land to become artisans', '. The population of the Ming boomed; estimates for the population of the Ming range from 160 to 200 million.', 'Rural markets during the Ming[edit]\nMing agriculture was much changed from the earlier areas; firstly, gigantic areas, devoting and specializing in cash crops, sprung up to demand from the new market economy. Secondly, agricultural tools and carts, some water-powered, help to create a gigantic agricultural surplus which formed the basis of the rural economy. Besides rice, other crops were grown on a large scale.[5]', ""Although images of autarkic farmers who had no connection to the rest of China may have some merit for the earlier Han and T'ang dynasties, this was certainly not the case for the Ming dynasty. During the Ming dynasty, the increase in population and the decrease in quality land made it necessary that farmers make a living off cash crops. Many of these markets appeared in the rural countryside, where goods were exchanged and bartered.[6]"", 'A second type of market that developed in China was the urban-rural type, in which rural goods were sold to urban dwellers. This was particular the case when landlords decided to reside in the cities, and use income coming from rural land holding to facilitate exchange in the cities. Another way this type of market was used was professional merchants who bought rural goods in large quantities.[6]', 'The third type of market was the ""national market"" which was developed during the Song dynasty but particularly enhanced during the Ming. This market involved not only the exchange described above, but also products produced directly for the market. Unlike earlier dynasties, many Ming peasants were no longer producing only products they needed; many of them produced products for the market, which then they sold at a profit.[6]\nTrade and investment[edit]\nMain article: Haijin', 'Trade and investment[edit]\nMain article: Haijin\nIn the early Ming, after the devastation of the war which expelled the Mongols, the Hongwu Emperor imposed severe restrictions on trade (the ""haijin""). Believing that agriculture was the basis of the economy, Hongwu favored that industry over all else, including that of merchants. After his death, most of his policies were reversed by his successors. By the late Ming, the state was losing power to the very merchants which Hongwu had wanted to restrict.', ""The Ming dynasty also engaged in a thriving trade with both Europe and Japan. The amount of silver flowing into the Ming dynasty was estimated by Joseph Needham at 300 million taels, which is equivalent to more than 190 billion dollars in today's money. In addition to silver, the Ming also imported many European firearms, in order to ensure the modernness of their weapons."", 'Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy, and was aided by the construction of canals, roads, and bridges by the Ming government. The Ming saw the rise of several merchant clans such as the Huai and Jin clans, who disposed of large amounts of wealth.

Through at least the late 1980s Epson continued to release laptops such as the L3s.\nGrid Compass[edit]\nMain article: Grid Compass', 'The first laptop in the modern form was the Grid Compass 1101, designed by Bill Moggridge in 1979–80, and released in 1983. Enclosed in a magnesium case, it introduced the now familiar clamshell design, in which the flat display folded shut against the keyboard. The computer could be run from batteries, and was equipped with a 320×200-pixel electroluminescent display and 384\xa0kilobyte bubble memory. It was not IBM-compatible, and its high price (US$8,000–10,000) limited it to specialized applications. However, it was used heavily by the U.S', 'Kaypro 2000[edit]\nPossibly the first commercial IBM-compatible laptop was the Kaypro 2000, introduced in 1985. With its brushed aluminum clamshell case, it was remarkably similar in design to modern laptops. It featured a 25 line by 80 character LCD, a detachable keyboard, and a pop-up 90\xa0mm (3.5-inch) floppy drive.\nIBM PC Convertible[edit]\nAlso among the first commercial IBM-compatible laptops was the IBM PC Convertible, introduced in 1986. It had a CGA-compatible LCD and 2 floppy drives. It weighed 13 pounds (5.9\xa0kg).\nToshiba T1100, T1000, and T1200[edit]', 'Toshiba launched the Toshiba T1100 in 1985, and has subsequently described it as ""the world\'s first mass-market laptop computer"".[7] It did not have a hard drive, and ran entirely from floppy disks. The CPU was a 4.77\xa0MHz Intel 80C88, a variation of the popular Intel 8088, and the display was a monochrome, text-only 640x200 LCD. It was followed in 1987 by the T1000 and T1200. Although limited floppy-based DOS machines, with the operating system stored in ROM, the Toshiba models were small and light enough to be carried in a backpack, and could be run from lead-acid batteries', 'The first laptops successful on a large scale came in large part due to a Request For Proposal (RFP) by the U.S. Air Force in 1987. This contract would eventually lead to the purchase of over 200,000 laptops. Competition to supply this contract was fiercely contested and the major PC companies of the time; IBM Corporation, To shins, Compaq, NEC, and Zenith Data Systems (ZDS), rushed to develop laptops in an attempt to win this deal. ZDS, which had earlier won a landmark deal with the IRS for its Z-171, was awarded this contract for its SupersPort series', "". The SupersPort series was originally launched with an Intel 8086 processor, dual floppy disk drives, a backlit, blue and white STN LCD screen, and a NiCd battery pack. Later models featured an Intel 80286 processor and a 20 MB hard disk drive. On the strength of this deal, ZDS became the world's largest laptop supplier in 1987 and 1988. ZDS partnered with Tottori Sanyo in the design and manufacturing of these laptops. This relationship is notable because it was the first deal between a major brand and an Asian original equipment manufacturer."", 'Compaq SLT/286[edit]\nBy the end of the 1980s, laptop computers were becoming popular among business people. The COMPAQ SLT/286 debuted in October 1988, being the first battery-powered laptop to support an internal hard disk drive and a VGA compatible LCD screen. It weighed 14\xa0lbs.[9]\nNEC UltraLite[edit]\nMain article: NEC UltraLite', 'The NEC UltraLite, released in mid-1989, was perhaps the first ""notebook"" computer, weighing just 2\xa0kg (4.4\xa0lbs). In lieu of a floppy or hard drive, it contained a 2\xa0megabyte RAM drive, but this reduced its utility as well as its size. Although portable computers with clamshell LCD screens already existed before it, the Ultralite was the first computer in a notebook form-factor. It was significantly smaller than all portable computers that came before it. People can actually carry-it like a notebook and fold its clamshell LCD like a book cover over the rest of its body.\nApple[edit]']","The portable micro computer the “Portal"" of the French company R2E Micral CCMC officially appeared in September 1980"
173,what is the role of hcl in the stomach,"Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach plays a key role in digestion by activating digestive enzymes, breaking down proteins, and creating an acidic environment for optimal protein digestion. It also has a disinfectant effect, protecting against bacterial infections.","['The stomach is a major organ of the gastrointestinal tract and digestive system. It is a consistently J-shaped organ joined to the esophagus at its upper end and to the duodenum at its lower end. Gastric acid (informally gastric juice), produced in the stomach plays a vital role in the digestive process, and mainly contains hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride. A peptide hormone, gastrin, produced by G cells in the gastric glands, stimulates the production of gastric juice which activates the digestive enzymes', '. Pepsinogen is a precursor enzyme (zymogen) produced by the gastric chief cells, and gastric acid activates this to the enzyme pepsin which begins the digestion of proteins. As these two chemicals would damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by innumerable gastric glands in the stomach, to provide a slimy protective layer against the damaging effects of the chemicals on the inner layers of the stomach.', ""In the small intestine, the pH becomes crucial; it needs to be finely balanced in order to activate digestive enzymes. The chyme is very acidic, with a low pH, having been released from the stomach and needs to be made much more alkaline. This is achieved in the duodenum by the addition of bile from the gall bladder combined with the bicarbonate secretions from the pancreatic duct and also from secretions of bicarbonate-rich mucus from duodenal glands known as Brunner's glands"", '. The chyme arrives in the intestines having been released from the stomach through the opening of the pyloric sphincter. The resulting alkaline fluid mix neutralises the gastric acid which would damage the lining of the intestine. The mucus component lubricates the walls of the intestine.', 'Gastric acid, gastric juice or stomach acid, is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids. Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed', '. Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate, a base, to buffer the fluid, ensuring that it does not become too acidic. These cells also produce mucus, which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract.', 'The main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid which is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the gastric glands in the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5[1] in the human stomach lumen, the acidity being maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase', '. The parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as an alkaline tide.', 'HCl + NaHCO3 → NaCl + H2CO3\nThe carbonic acid rapidly equilibrates with carbon dioxide and water through catalysis by carbonic anhydrase enzymes bound to the gut epithelial lining,[6] leading to a net release of carbon dioxide gas within the lumen associated with neutralisation. In the absorptive upper intestine, such as the duodenum, both the dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid will tend to equilibrate with the blood, leading to most of the gas produced on neutralisation being exhaled through the lungs.\nRole in disease[edit]', 'Role in disease[edit]\nIn hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria, there is low or no gastric acid in the stomach, potentially leading to problems as the disinfectant properties of the gastric lumen are decreased. In such conditions, there is greater risk of infections of the digestive tract (such as infection with Vibrio or Helicobacter bacteria).\nIn Zollinger–Ellison syndrome and hypercalcemia, there are increased gastrin levels, leading to excess gastric acid production, which can cause gastric ulcers.']","plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids"

From the following August, this list was more frequently updated, to be published most months.[3] Significant changes were implemented in January 1999 and again in July 2006, as a reaction to criticisms of the system.[4] Historical records of the rankings, such as listed at FIFA.com, reflect the method of calculation in use at the time, as the current method has not been applied retrospectively to rankings prior to July 2006', '. Membership of FIFA has expanded from 167 to 209 since the rankings began; all 209 members are currently included in the rankings.', 'In July 2008, Spain took over the lead for the first time, having won UEFA Euro 2008. Brazil began a sixth stint at the top of the rankings in July 2009 after winning the 2009 Confederations Cup, and Spain regained the title in November 2009 after winning every match in qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn April 2010, Brazil returned to the top of the table.

In July 2015, Argentina reached the top spot for the first time since 2008, after reaching both the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, as well as the 2015 Copa America Final. In November 2015, Belgium became the leader in the FIFA rankings for the first time, after topping their Euro 2016 qualifying group.

It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Scholars have suggested that this is either the Roman province of Galatia in southern Anatolia, or a large region defined by an ethnic group of Celtic people in central Anatolia.[1]', 'Paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding Gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law during the Apostolic Age. Paul argues that the Gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of the revelation of Christ. Galatians has exerted enormous influence on the history of Christianity, the development of Christian theology, and the study of the apostle Paul.[2]\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Composition\n1.1 Authenticity\n1.2 Galatia\n1.2.1 North Galatian view\n1.2.2 South Galatian view', 'Some scholars date the original composition to c. 50–60 AD.[5] Other scholars agree that Galatians was written between the late 40s and early 50s.[6]\nAuthenticity[edit]\nMain article: Authorship of the Pauline Epistles', ""Main article: Authorship of the Pauline Epistles\nBiblical scholars agree that Galatians is a true example of Paul's writing. The main arguments in favor of the authenticity of Galatians include its style and themes, which are common to the core letters of the Pauline corpus.[citation needed] Moreover, Paul's possible description of the Council of Jerusalem (Gal.2:1–10) gives a different point of view from the description in Acts 15:2–29, if it is, in fact, describing the Jerusalem Council.[7]"", 'The central dispute in the letter concerns the question of how Gentiles could convert to Christianity, which shows that this letter was written at a very early stage in church history, when the vast majority of Christians were Jewish or Jewish proselytes, which historians refer to as the Jewish Christians. Another indicator that the letter is early is that there is no hint in the letter of a developed organization within the Christian community at large. This puts it during the lifetime of Paul himself.[7]', ""Nevertheless, a small number of scholars have questioned Paul's authorship of Galatians, such as Bruno Bauer, Abraham Loman, C. H. Weisse and Frank R. McGuire.[8]\nGalatia[edit]"", 'Paul\'s letter is addressed ""to the churches of Galatia"" (Galatians 1:2), but the location of these churches is a matter of debate. A minority of scholars have argued that the ""Galatia"" is an ethnic reference to a Celtic people living in northern Asia Minor, but most agree that it is a geographical reference to the Roman province in central Asia Minor, which had been settled by immigrant Celts in the 270s BC and retained Gaulish features of culture and language in Paul\'s day', 'South Galatian view[edit]\nThe South Galatian view holds that Paul wrote Galatians before or shortly after the First Jerusalem Council, probably on his way to it, and that it was written to churches he had presumably planted during either his time in Tarsus (he would have traveled a short distance, since Tarsus is in Cilicia) after his first visit to Jerusalem as a Christian,[14] or during his first missionary journey, when he traveled throughout southern Galatia. If it was written to the believers in South Galatia, it would likely have been written in 49.[15]\nEarliest epistle[edit]', ""A third theory[16] is that Galatians 2:1–10 describes Paul and Barnabas' visit to Jerusalem described in Acts 11:30 and 12:25. This theory holds that the epistle was written before the Council was convened, possibly making it the earliest of Paul's epistles. According to this theory, the revelation mentioned (Gal 2:2) corresponds with the prophecy of Agabus (Acts 11:27–28). This view holds that the private speaking about the gospel shared among the Gentiles precludes the Acts 15 visit, but fits perfectly with Acts 11.

This started in the 2009 calendar year. The Fiat Ducato cargo van design has been adopted and is sold as the Ram ProMaster in North American markets, filling the gap created when Daimler ended production of the Dodge Sprinter in 2008.

Ram will always have the Dodge emblem inside and outside and they will be \'vinned\' (Vehicle Identification Number) as a Dodge', '. We need to continue to market as Ram so Dodge can have a different brand identity: hip, cool, young, energetic. That will not fit the campaign for truck buyers.

191,who has given the theory of unbalanced economic growth,Albert O. Hirschman has given the theory of unbalanced economic growth.,"['Unbalanced growth is a natural path of economic development. Situations that countries are in at any one point in time reflect their previous investment decisions and development. Accordingly, at any point in time desirable investment programs that are not balanced investment packages may still advance welfare. Unbalanced investment can complement or correct existing imbalances. Once such an investment is made, a new imbalance is likely to appear, requiring further compensating investments. Therefore, growth need not take place in a balanced way', '. Supporters of the unbalanced growth doctrine include Albert O. Hirschman, Hans Singer, Paul Streeten, Marcus Fleming, Prof. Rostov and J. Sheehan.', 'Hirschman contends that deliberate unbalancing of the economy according to the strategy is the best method of development and if the economy is to be kept moving ahead, the task of development policy is to maintain tension, disproportions and disequilibrium. Balanced growth should not be the goal but rather the maintenance of existing imbalances, which can be seen from profit and losses. Therefore, the sequence that leads away from equilibrium is precisely an ideal pattern for development. Unequal development of various sectors often generates conditions for rapid development', '. More-developed industries provide undeveloped industries an incentive to grow. Hence, development of underdeveloped countries should be based on this strategy.', 'The path of unbalanced growth is described by three phases:\nComplementary\nInduced investment\nExternal economies', 'Singer believed that desirable investment programs always exist within a country that represent unbalanced investment to complement the existing imbalance. These investments create a new imbalance, requiring another balancing investment. One sector will always grow faster than another, so the need for unbalanced growth will continue as investments must complement existing imbalance. Hirschman states “If the economy is to be kept moving ahead, the task of development policy is to maintain tensions, disproportions and disequilibrium”', 'Notes[edit]\nReferences[edit]\nHirschman, Albert O.

The contestants had prepared a special 'Karan Johar style’ performance as part of the upcoming Valentine’s Day week. They danced on the tunes of some famous numbers from the iconic films of Johar like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, Student of the Year. Johar was positively moved by this gesture."", '‘’Hum ek baar jeete hain, hum ek baar marte hain’’ (We live once, die once) which was initially delivered by Shahrukh Khan in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was the first dialogue for the evening. Bagri and Kapur performed in the first act for the evening which was based on the nuances of a deadly disease Alzheimer’s disease. Shetty stated that this act reminded him of a famous movie by Ajay Devgan and Kajol- U Me Aur Hum. The story spans over a few decades and the actors had portrayed the changeover quite well. Bagri scored seventeen and Kapur scored nineteen for this performance', '‘’Main kisi ki zaroorat nahin, khwaish banna chati hoon’’ (I don’t want to be someone’s necessity, I want to be his desire) was the dialogue for the second act of the evening. Nanda played the role of a gangster Narayan Mhatre and Bharadwaj supported him brilliantly with the role of a lady, who had come to take her revenge. The act was appreciated by the audience and Nanda scored fourteen and Bharadwaj scored fifteen respectively. Bharadwaj brought her mother on stage, and proposed to her as her valentine, and thanked her for everything.', '‘’Mere paas bangla hai, gadi hai, tere paas kya hai’’ Today I own bungalows, cars, what do you own?) was the dialogue for the third act for the evening. It was presented in a very different twist than the original one from Deewar. Krislinzki played the role of a high-society mother-in-law and Singh played the role of her daughter-in-law who came from lower strata of the society. The funny punches of this act were enjoyed by all and Krislinzki scored sixteen and Singh scored eighteen for their respective performances.', '‘’Ek baar jo maine commitment kar di, to main apni bhi nahin suntan hoon’’ (Once I give a commitment, then I live up to it) was the dialogue for the fourth act for the evening. Mehrotra played the role of Tara Singh and Sharma played the role of his wife Sakina. The audience was reminded of the brilliant performance of Sunny Deol in Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. The comic timing of Mehrotra was appreciated by both the judges, and Johar said that this is his finest performance so far. Mehrotra scored a perfect twenty. Sharma was just supporting Mehrotra in this act.', 'Lagaan - Wikipedia\n \nLagaan \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nThis article is about the Indian film.

Made on a then-unprecedented budget of ₹250 million (equivalent to ₹700\xa0million or US$11\xa0million in 2016), the film was shot in an ancient village near Bhuj, India.', ""The film is set in the Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj. The story revolves around a small village whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny."", 'Lagaan received critical acclaim and awards at international film festivals, as well as many Indian film awards.

It consists of a trilogy of storylines that ran from 1993 to 1994, consisting of ""Knightfall"", ""Knightquest"", and ""KnightsEnd"".[note 1] The story takes place over approximately six months. Bruce Wayne (Batman) suffers burnout and is systematically assaulted and crippled by a ""super steroid""-enhanced genius named Bane. Wayne is replaced as Batman by an apprentice named Jean-Paul Valley (a.k.a. Azrael), who becomes increasingly violent and unstable, tarnishing Batman\'s reputation', '. Eventually, Wayne is healed through paranormal means, and reclaims his role as Batman.', ""Bane breaks Batman's back in a splash page from Batman #497 (July 1993). Art by Jim Aparo."", ""Over the next few issues, Batman becomes weaker and weaker as each criminal is put away. The rescue of Mayor Krol from the teaming of the Joker and Scarecrow pushes Batman to his mental and physical limits: a dose of Scarecrow's fear gas makes him relive the murder of Jason Todd, which he considers to be his greatest failure. After this encounter, Bane's men assault Batman before he himself makes his move and attacks him at Wayne Manor, his home as his alter-ego—by this time; Bane had deduced the secret identity of Batman. The fight between Bruce Wayne and Bane is detailed in Batman #497"", '. By this time, Batman is so exhausted from the exertion of catching the escaped criminals that he cannot even defend himself; Bane beats him mercilessly before breaking Wayne\'s back over his knee inside the Batcave below the manor, symbolically ""breaking"" Batman.[4] Bane takes the grievously-wounded Wayne (still costumed in the Batman outfit) downtown to Gotham Square and throws him from a rooftop to demonstrate his superiority to the populace. Quick action by Robin and Alfred spares Batman\'s life, but at great cost - he is left a paraplegic', "". With Batman incapacitated, Bane assumes control of Gotham City's underworld and takes over several illegal operations within it."", 'After his defeat, Bruce Wayne enlists the aid of Dr. Shondra Kinsolving to rehabilitate him and asks Jean-Paul Valley to take up the mantle of Batman so that Gotham has a protector. Tim Drake argues with Bruce to allow Dick Grayson (the former Robin and then-current Nightwing) to become Batman, as he is more experienced and mentally competent. Bruce replies that Grayson has his own responsibilities and would only take up the mantle of the Bat reluctantly (Dick later expressed resentment at not being asked to stand in as Batman)', '. Similar stories followed for Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Green Arrow, with Green Lantern Hal Jordan being driven insane and replaced with Kyle Rayner, a new Wonder Woman being appointed by Hippolyta, Aquaman losing his hand, and Green Arrow dying in a plane crash as his long-lost son took over the role.', 'In the opening of the novelisation, KnightFall, Dennis O\'Neil stated that part of the reason ""Knightfall"" was written was due to the recent popularity of more ""ruthless"" heroes such as the Terminator and James Bond in films, as editors were starting to wonder if readers would prefer a Batman who was willing to kill his opponents.\nDuring DC vs. Marvel, Bane attempts to break Captain America\'s back in a fight in a similar maneuver, but is caught off-guard when Captain America\'s shield returns to its owner to strike Bane in the back of the head and knock him out.[6]', ""In the climax to Year One of Injustice: Gods Among Us, Superman confronts Batman in the Batcave as Batman is downloading the formula to a pill that can grant the user superhuman strength and durability, stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. While Superman does not want to kill Batman, he chooses to paralyze him by breaking his back in a similar fashion to Bane (albeit by standing on Batman's back instead of slamming him over his knee as Bane did). This puts Batman out of commission for much of Year Two as he heals.\nReception[edit]""]",Jean-Paul Valley (a.k.a. Azrael)

French settlers visited the area as early as 1719.', 'Warsaw was platted in 1837.[7] The city was incorporated in 1843 and designated as the county seat of Benton County. The city was named after Warsaw, the capital city of Poland, in honor of the Revolutionary War hero Tadeusz Kościuszko, who was Polish and had also fought for independence in his homeland. Warsaw was a steamboat port, the furthest point up the Osage River they could navigate.[8]\nPermanent immigrants to the area were Germans, Scotch-Irish, and English, as well as transplant farmers from Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Carolinas, first arriving around 1820.', '. Settlers emigrating from the eastern United States were spurred by various motives, among them religious persecution, economic incentives, and the prospect of new wealth and new freedoms in what was then a largely unspoiled and unregulated country. By the 1840s, several popular and well-established routes had been blazed through the continental interior to destinations in the far west, including the Oregon Trail, California Trail, and Mormon Trail. After the end of the Mexican–American War in 1849, vast new American conquests again enticed mass immigration', '. Legislation like the Donation Land Claim Act and significant events like the California Gold Rush further lured colonists to travel overland to the west.', ""The Oregon Trail, was the longest of the overland routes used in the westward expansion of the United States, was first traced by explorers and fur traders for traveling to the Oregon Country. The main route of the Oregon Trail stopped at the Hudson's Bay Company Fort Hall, a major resupply route along the trail near present-day Pocatello and where the California Trail split off to the south. Then the Oregon Trail crossed the Snake River Plain of present-day southern Idaho and the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon before reaching the Willamette Valley"", "". It was the only practical way for settlers in wagons without tools, livestock, or supplies to cross the mountains and usually thought critical to the colonization of the American West. Some of the first to travel the Oregon Trail were Christian missionaries, members of the Methodist Episcopal Church who established the Methodist Mission in 1834. Even though they didn't make many converts, they were impressed by the short amount of time needed to reach the Pacific Coast. Rumors about how the sun always shone there and wheat grew as tall as a man attracted American settlers."", 'American settlers began following the trail in 1841, with the first recorded colonist wagon traingroup being the 1843 ""Great Migration"" of about 900 colonists, led by Marcus Whitman. The Provisional Government of Oregon was established by such colonists in 1843, generally limited to the Willamette Valley. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 divided the Oregon Country between Great Britain and the United States, mostly along the 49th parallel. The Territory of Oregon was established shortly afterwards, in 1848, and over 12,000 American settlers made the journey there during the decade.', 'Families usually began their journey at Independence, Missouri, near the Missouri River with the best time to travel being from April to September. The journey to cross the entire Oregon Trail in a covered wagon took from four to six months, following a winding trail 2,000 miles (3,200\xa0km) through prairies, deserts, and across mountains to the Pacific Northwest. The journey was a severe test of strength and endurance so travelers often joined wagon trains traveling about 12–15 miles (19–24\xa0km) per day. Settlers often had to cross flooded rivers', '. Settlers often had to cross flooded rivers. Indians attacked the wagon trains; however, of the 10,000 deaths that occurred from 1835 to 1855, only 4 percent resulted from Indian attacks. Cholera, smallpox, and firearms accidents were the chief causes of death on the trail. Food, water, and wood were always scarce, and the travelers often encountered contaminated water holes. During summer, the trail was crowded with wagon trains, army units, missionaries, hunting parties, traders, and even sightseeing tours']",No answer

This is closest to the choroid.\nThese layers can be grouped into 4 main processing stages: photoreception; transmission to bipolar cells; transmission to ganglion cells, which also contain photoreceptors, the photosensitive ganglion cells; and transmission along the optic nerve. At each synaptic stage there are also laterally connecting horizontal and amacrine cells.', 'The optic nerve is a central tract of many axons of ganglion cells connecting primarily to the lateral geniculate body, a visual relay station in the diencephalon (the rear of the forebrain). It also projects to the superior colliculus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the nucleus of the optic tract. It passes through the other layers, creating the optic disc in primates.[10]', '[edit on Wikidata]\nThe optic chiasm or optic chiasma ( /ɒptɪk kaɪæzəm/; Greek χίασμα, ""crossing"", from the Greek χιάζω \'to mark with an X\', after the Greek letter \'Χ\', chi) is the part of the brain where the optic nerves partially cross. The optic chiasm is located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus.[1] The optic chiasm is found in all vertebrates, although in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) it is located within the brain.[2][3]\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Structure\n2 Other animals\n3 Additional images\n4 History\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nStructure[edit]', '6 References\n7 External links\nStructure[edit]\nThe optic nerve fibres on the nasal sides of each retina cross over (decussate) to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm (decussation of medial fibers). The temporal hemiretina, on the other hand, stays on the same side. The inferonasal retina are related to anterior portion of the optic chiasm whereas superonasal retinal fibers are related to the posterior portion of the optic chiasm.', 'The crossing over of optic nerve fibres at the optic chiasm allows the visual cortex to receive the same hemispheric visual field from both eyes. Superimposing and processing these monocular visual signals allow the visual cortex to generate binocular and stereoscopic vision. For example, the right visual cortex receives the temporal visual field from the left eye, and the nasal visual field from the right eye, which results in the right visual cortex producing a binocular image of the left hemispheric visual field', '. The net result of optic nerve crossing over at the optic chiasm is for the right cerebral hemisphere to sense and process left hemispheric vision, and for the left cerebral hemisphere to sense and process right hemispheric vision.[4]', 'This crossing is an adaptive feature of frontally oriented eyes, found mostly in predatory animals requiring precise visual depth perception. (Prey animals, with laterally positioned eyes, have little binocular vision, so there is a more complete crossover of visual signals[citation needed].) Beyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, the optic nerves become optic tracts. The signals are passed on to the lateral geniculate body, in turn giving them to the occipital cortex (the outer matter of the rear brain).[5]\nOther animals[edit]', 'Other animals[edit]\nIn Siamese cats with certain genotypes of the albino gene, this wiring is disrupted, with more of the nerve-crossing than is normal, as a number of scholars have reported.[6] To compensate for lack of crossing in their brains, they cross their eyes (strabismus).[7]\nThis is also seen in albino tigers, as Guillery & Kaas report.[8]\nAdditional images[edit]\nScheme showing central connections of the optic nerves and optic tracts.\nBase of brain.\n3D schematic representation of optic tracts\nTransformations of the visual field toward the visual map on the primary visual cortex.']",optic chiasm
