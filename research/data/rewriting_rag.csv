0,all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are,"All the alpha motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers and are part of motor units. Somatic motor neurons originating in the central nervous system project their axons to skeletal muscles, including those of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles. Alpha motor neurons are responsible for voluntary skeletal muscle contraction and contribute to muscle tone and the stretch reflex. No answer","['In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. This process is also called the stretch reflex.', 'Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the main force-generating component of a muscle. Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called ventral horn cells. A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average.[15] The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. Motor units are split up into 3 categories:[16] Main Article: Motor Unit', 'Somatic motor neurons[edit]\nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles [14] (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons, beta efferent neurons, and gamma efferent neurons. They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.', 'Motor systems are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain.[7] Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming', 'In consequence:\nthe motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic (involving only one motor neuron, respectively, somatic and branchial, which synapses onto the muscle).\nthe command of visceral muscles is disynaptic (involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron located in the CNS, which synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle).', 'A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.[1] There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons']",Somatic

(Source: Rate of evolution section)","['Rate of evolution[edit]\nThe first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period (about 540\xa0million years ago).[10] The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the ""Cambrian explosion"". One of the many hypotheses for ""causes"" of the Cambrian explosion is the ""Light Switch"" theory of Andrew Parker: It holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution.[11] Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision.', 'Complex eyes appeared first within the few million years of the Cambrian explosion. From before the Cambrian, no evidence of eyes has survived, but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale.[4] Eyes are adapted to the various requirements of their owners.

He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors.[143] He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved', 'During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction.[27]\nThe primitive nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera.', 'The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called ""eyespots"". Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms.

The beds were a la duchesse, but in France itself there was great variety both of name and shape. The custom of the ""bed of justice"" upon which the king of France reclined when he was present in parliament, the princes being seated, the great officials standing, and the lesser officials kneeling, was held to denote the royal power even more than the throne.', 'In the 15th century beds became very large, reaching 7 to 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4\xa0m) by 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1\xa0m). The mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks, straw, or feathers. At this time great personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property about with them, including beds and bed-hangings, and for this reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks to be covered up; but about the beginning of the 16th century bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative, since the lords remained in the same place for longer periods.\nRenaissance and modern Europe', '. The space between bed and wall was called the ruelle, and very intimate friends were received there. The 14th century is also the time when feather beds became highly prized possessions.[8]', '. During the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used in high society in France till the end of the Ancien Régime. The earliest of which mention has been found belonged to Charles the Bold. They had curtains over a light framework, and were in their way as fine as the stationary beds.', 'Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame, the mattress resting either on a solid base, often wood slats, or a sprung base. Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people', 'In the 17th century, which has been called ""the century of magnificent beds"", the style a la duchesse, with tester and curtains only at the head, replaced the more enclosed beds in France, though they lasted much longer in England. Louis XIV had an enormous number of sumptuous beds, as many as 413 being described in the inventories of his palaces. Some of them had embroideries enriched with pearls, and figures on a silver or golden ground. The great bed at Versailles had crimson velvet curtains on which ""The Triumph of Venus"" was embroidered']",the 12th century

17,the seed of a gymnosperm seed is made in the,"In conifers, gymnosperm seeds are developed on the surface of scales or leaves, often modified to form cones. [1]","['. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or solitary as in Yew, Torreya, Ginkgo.[1]', 'The gymnosperms are a group of seed-producing plants that includes conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes. The term ""gymnosperm"" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, ""naked"" and σπέρμα sperma, ""seed""), meaning ""naked seeds"". The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary', '. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat.[16]', 'Gymnosperms, like all vascular plants, have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle, which means they spend most of their life cycle with diploid cells, while the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived. Two spore types, microspores and megaspores, are typically produced in pollen cones or ovulate cones, respectively. Gametophytes, as with all heterosporous plants, develop within the spore wall. Pollen grains (microgametophytes) mature from microspores, and ultimately produce sperm cells. Megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule', '. Gymnosperms produce multiple archegonia, which produce the female gamete. During pollination, pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from the pollen cone to the ovule. Pollen is usually moved by wind or insects. Whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle. The pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms', 'Cycads are the next most abundant group of gymnosperms, with two or three families, 11 genera, and approximately 338 species. A majority of cycads are native to tropical climates and are most abundantly found in regions near the equator. The other extant groups are the 95-100 species of Gnetales and one species of Ginkgo.[2]\nUses[edit]\nGymnosperms have major economic uses. Pine, fir, spruce, and cedar are all examples of conifers that are used for lumber, paper production, and resin. Some other common uses for gymnosperms are soap, varnish, nail polish, food, gum, and perfumes.']",either on the surface of scales or leaves

The book explains how Harriet Tubman used the song “Wade in the Water” to tell escaping slaves to get off the trail and into the water to make sure that the dogs employed by slavers lost their trail.[4]\nIn popular culture[edit]', 'One version of the song performed by The Staple Singers became a part of the civil rights movement in the US.[1] ""Wade in the Water"" was a popular instrumental hit in 1966 for the Ramsey Lewis Trio[5], which prompted further instrumental recordings by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, and Billy Preston (both 1967). The melody was used for the 1988 Tony! Toni! Toné! hit ""Little Walter"". The version by Golden Gate Quartet also appears on the compilation album Nick Cave - Roots & Collaborations (2009), establishing the song as one of the musical sources that have inspired the Australian artist', 'Cooke incorporated his own personal experiences as well into the song, such as encounters in Memphis, Shreveport and Birmingham, to reflect the lives and struggles of all African-Americans of the time.[8] The lines ""I don\'t know what\'s up there / Beyond the sky"" could refer to Cooke\'s doubt for absolute true justice on earth.[8] The final verse, in which Cooke pleads for his ""brother"" to help him, is a metaphor for what Alexander described as ""the establishment"" The verse continues, \'But he winds up knocking me / back down on my knees.\'""[8]\nPersonnel[edit]']",No answer
30,how often does a speed limit sign need to be posted,No answer,"['In most of the world speed limit signs display the limitation within a red circle. This design follows the style set out by the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, with the exception of United States and Canada.[citation needed] All countries globally worldwide (except the United Kingdom and United States) use metric speed limits in kilometres per hour.[citation needed] Metric signs are optional in the United States though less commonly seen, while Samoa uses both units', 'Signs are normally placed on both sides of the road and in some places there are small (less than 1/4 the size of the sign) rectangular orange reflector flags attached to both upper right corners of both signs. The speed limit sign marking the new speed zone may also have the orange flags; this practice can be observed in New York on highways where the speed limit varies such as New York State Route 17.\nSpeed limits on European Motorways in km/h', '. In the European Union, large signposts showing the national (default) speed limits of the respective country are usually erected immediately after border crossings, with a repeater sign some 200 to 500\xa0m (660 to 1,640\xa0ft) after the first sign. Some places provide an additional ""speed zone ahead"" ahead of the restriction and speed limit reminder signs may appear at regular intervals which may be painted on the road surface.', 'In the United States, the signs are usually rectangular with the words ""SPEED LIMIT"" and the values in black on a white background. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration\'s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides guidelines for the appearance of speed limit signs. In Alaska and California, speed limits are often labeled ""MAXIMUM SPEED"" instead. In Oregon, most speed limit signs just say ""SPEED"" and the number. Canada has similar signs bearing the legend ""MAXIMUM"" and in km/h instead of mph', 'Express road\n60\n80\n100\n120\nx\nRoad\n60\n80\n100\nx\nx\nMinimum speed limits[edit]\nUK minimum speed limit sign\nSome roads also have ""minimum speed limits"", where slow speeds can impede traffic flow or be dangerous.[59]\nSigns often use blue circles based on the obligatory signs of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals.

31,when are centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants used,"Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants like baclofen and tizanidine are used in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain, particularly in neurological conditions such as spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. They are also prescribed for tension headaches and may be used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms. However, their effectiveness varies depending on the condition and there is limited evidence supporting their use as first-line treatments.","['Other skeletal muscle relaxants of that type used around the world come from a number of drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen, [8] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax skeletal muscles include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination', 'In general, muscle relaxants are not approved by FDA for long-term use. However, rheumatologists often prescribe cyclobenzaprine nightly on a daily basis to increase stage 4 sleep. By increasing this sleep stage, patients feel more refreshed in the morning. Improving sleep is also beneficial for patients who have fibromyalgia.[20]\nMuscle relaxants such as tizanidine are prescribed in the treatment of tension headaches.[21]', 'Muscle relaxants (according to one study) were not advised for orthopedic conditions, but rather for neurological conditions such as spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.[15] Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.\nMuscle relaxants are thought to be useful in painful disorders based on the theory that pain induces spasm and spasm causes pain. However, considerable evidence contradicts this theory.[18]', '. Spasmolytics, also known as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions. While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants,[1][2] the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only.[3][4]', 'Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and methocarbamol are commonly prescribed for low back pain or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome.[15] However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),[16][17] and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants.[15] Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs', 'Most sources still use the term ""centrally acting muscle relaxant"". According to MeSH, dantrolene is usually classified as a centrally acting muscle relaxant.[10] The World Health Organization, in its ATC, uses the term ""centrally acting agents"",[11] but adds a distinct category of ""directly acting agents"", for dantrolene.[12] Use of this terminology dates back to at least 1973.[13]\nThe term ""spasmolytic"" is also considered a synonym for antispasmodic.[14]\nClinical use[edit]']",to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions

41,which site of an enzyme is called allosteric site,"An allosteric site is a regulatory site on an allosteric protein where modulator molecules (allosteric regulators) bind to alter enzyme activity. Ligands bind to these sites to induce conformational changes in the enzyme, modulating its activity. Activation or inhibition depends on whether the ligand activates or inhibits the enzyme. For example, in ATP synthase, the c-ring rotation within the α3β3 structure causes conformational changes leading to ATP synthesis. References: [11], [12].","['A regulatory site (also known as an ""allosteric site"") is a site on an allosteric protein to which a modulator molecule (or allosteric regulator) binds. This ligand-binding site on a receptor or enzyme is distinct from the active site. Allosteric modulators alter enzyme activity by binding to the regulatory site. Some allosteric regulators activate enzymes, while others inhibit them. The working hypothesis is that when allosteric regulators bind to the regulatory site, the protein undergoes conformational changes which changes the enzyme\'s activity.', 'The binding change mechanism involves the active site of a β subunit\'s cycling between three states.[11] In the ""loose"" state, ADP and phosphate enter the active site; in the adjacent diagram, this is shown in pink. The enzyme then undergoes a change in shape and forces these molecules together, with the active site in the resulting ""tight"" state (shown in red) binding the newly produced ATP molecule with very high affinity. Finally, the active site cycles back to the open state (orange), releasing ATP and binding more ADP and phosphate, ready for the next cycle of ATP production.[12]', '. The c-ring is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk (consisting primarily of the gamma subunit), causing it to rotate within the alpha3beta3 of F1 causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that leads to ATP synthesis.

48,what was the purpose of a revival meeting during the second great awakening,"Purpose and Methods: Revival meetings during the Second Great Awakening aimed to convert individuals to Christianity through emotional and enthusiastic gatherings. They used itinerant preachers, such as circuit riders, to reach remote areas. These meetings reflected Romanticism's emphasis on emotion and the supernatural.

Impact: Millions joined existing evangelical denominations or formed new ones. Converts believed the Awakening signaled a new millennial era. Reform movements emerged to address societal issues before the expected Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

Citation: [1], [2]","['The revivals enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[1]', 'Third (c. 1855–1900)\nFourth (c. 1960–1980)\nv\nt\ne\nThe Second Great Awakening was a Protestant religious revival during the early 19th century in the United States. The movement began around 1790, gained momentum by 1800 and, after 1820, membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1850s. The Second Great Awakening reflected Romanticism characterized by enthusiasm, emotion, and an appeal to the super-natural. It rejected the skeptical rationalism and deism of the Enlightenment.', 'Historians named the Second Great Awakening in the context of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s and of the Third Great Awakening of the late 1850s to early 1900s.

Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers, known as circuit riders, who sought out people in remote frontier locations', '.

They then went on to answer the query with, ""No. Sound is the sensation excited in the ear when the air or other medium is set in motion.""[4] This seems to imply that the question is posed not from a philosophical viewpoint, but from a purely scientific one', '. The magazine Scientific American corroborated the technical aspect of this question, while leaving out the philosophic side, a year later when they asked the question slightly reworded, ""If a tree were to fall on an uninhabited island, would there be any sound?"" And gave a more technical answer, ""Sound is vibration, transmitted to our senses through the mechanism of the ear, and recognized as sound only at our nerve centers. The falling of the tree or any other disturbance will produce vibration of the air. If there be no ears to hear, there will be no sound.""[5]', 'Can something exist without being perceived? – e.g. ""is sound only sound if a person hears it?"" The most immediate philosophical topic that the riddle introduces involves the existence of the tree (and the sound it produces) outside of human perception. If no one is around to see, hear, touch or smell the tree, how could it be said to exist? What is it to say that it exists when such an existence is unknown? Of course, from a scientific viewpoint, it exists.[7] It is human beings that are able to perceive it', '""The shrutis (a subdivision of the Vedas) and the sages say that the objects are only mental creations. They have no substantive being. Investigate the matter and ascertain the truth of the statement. The result will be the conclusion that the objective world is in the subjective consciousness."" (TWSRM, p.\xa0479).\nIn popular culture[edit]\nCanadian songwriter, social activist and environmentalist Bruce Cockburn poses the question in the chorus of his 1989 song ""If a Tree Falls"" and frames it with his lyrics as a pressing question regarding the cause and effect of deforestation.']",Charles Riborg Mann
55,who wants a heart in the wizard of oz,The character in The Wizard of Oz who desires a heart is the Tin Woodman.,"[""In Zelena's past, her childhood friend Stanum asks for her help in finding the Crimson Heart, a magical artifact that would be able to restore his human form after having been cursed by the Wicked Witch of the North to slowly turn into tin.

In the Present, The Black Fairy tempts Zelena with an offer to join her, only to have Zelena oppose her instead"", 'The Wizard turns out to be a ""humbug"" and can only provide a placebo heart made of silk and filled with sawdust. However, this is enough to please the Tin Woodman, who, with or without a heart, was all along the most tender and emotional of Dorothy\'s companions (just as the Scarecrow was the wisest and the Cowardly Lion the bravest). When he accidentally crushes an insect, he is grief-stricken and, ironically, claims that he must be careful about such things, while those with hearts do not need such care', 'Since youth, Stanum has been a woodcutter and one day when he first met Zelena, the daughter of another woodsman, he finds out that Zelena has magic and befriends her, regardless of whatever the children say about Zelena, who they see as a freak. Many years later, Stanum, now a man, is punished by the Wicked Witch of the North for chopping down a tree in her domain, and his body slowly begins to transform into tin. To prevent himself from completely becoming tin, Stanum seeks out help from Zelena (now the Wicked Witch of the West) at the Emerald City of Oz', ""In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Dorothy Gale befriends the Tin Woodman after they find him rusted in the forest, as he was caught in rain, and use his oil can to release him. He follows her to the Emerald City to get a heart from The Wizard. They are joined on their adventure by the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion. The Wizard sends Dorothy and her friends to the Winkie Country to kill the Wicked Witch of the West. The Tin Woodman's axe proves useful in this journey, both for chopping wood to create a bridge or raft as needed, and for chopping the heads off animals that threaten the party"", '. Unfortunately Zelena\'s actions and selfish greed for magic causes her to betray Stanum, whom she suspect was aligned with Dorothy by keeping the Crimson Heart for herself, leaving Stanum to transform into the Tin Man permanently. Some time later, when Robin Hood arrives in Oz in the episode ""Heart of Gold"", the Tin Man is seen on the side of the Yellow Brick Road, torn apart.', ""His desire for a heart notably contrasts with the Scarecrow's desire for brains, reflecting a common debate between the relative importance of the mind and the emotions. This occasions philosophical debate between the two friends as to why their own choices are superior; neither convinces the other, and Dorothy, listening, is unable to decide which one is right. Symbolically, because they remain with Dorothy throughout her quest, she is provided with both and need not select""]",the Tin Woodman

80,what is the first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis,The first basic process in the photosystem II light reaction of photosynthesis is the oxidation of two water molecules into a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions. This process is facilitated by the charge-separation reactions involving the photosystem II reaction center. Citation: [Context provided].,"['. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions; the electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active tyrosine residue that then reduces the oxidized chlorophyll a (called P680) that serves as the primary light-driven electron donor in the photosystem II reaction center. That photo receptor is in effect reset and is then able to repeat the absorption of another photon and the release of another photo-dissociated electron', 'CO2 + (AsO3−\n3) + photons → (AsO3−\n4) + CO[16]\ncarbon dioxide + arsenite + light energy → arsenate + carbon monoxide (used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.', 'In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin', '. However, since photosystem II is the first step of the Z-scheme, an external source of electrons is required to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a molecules. The source of electrons in green-plant and cyanobacterial photosynthesis is water', 'The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelius van Niel is therefore:[14]\nCO2 + 2H2A + photons → [\u200bCH2O\u200b] + 2A + H2O\ncarbon dioxide + electron donor + light energy → carbohydrate + oxidized electron donor + water\nSince water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is:\nCO2 + 2H2O + photons → [CH2O] + O2 + H2O\ncarbon dioxide + water + light energy → carbohydrate + oxygen + water', 'Contents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Overview\n2 Photosynthetic membranes and organelles\n3 Light-dependent reactions\n3.1 Z scheme\n3.2 Water photolysis\n4 Light-independent reactions\n4.1 Calvin cycle\n4.2 Carbon concentrating mechanisms\n4.2.1 On land\n4.2.2 In water\n5 Order and kinetics\n6 Efficiency\n7 Evolution\n7.1 Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts\n7.2 Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis\n8 Discovery\n8.1 Development of the concept\n8.2 C3\xa0: C4 photosynthesis research\n9 Factors\n9.1 Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature\n9.2 Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration\n10 See also']",one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron

87,where is most vascular tissue found in plants,"Xylem and phloem are found in the vascular bundles of plants. Xylem is typically located closer to the interior of the stem or root, while phloem is usually situated towards the exterior. In leaves, xylem is positioned near the adaxial surface, and phloem is near the abaxial surface. Their functions include conducting water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant. No answer","['. The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles. These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells. In stems and roots, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem. In the stems of some Asterales dicots, there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well.', 'The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes. The individual cells of phloem are connected end-to-end, just as the sections of a pipe might be. As the plant grows, new vascular tissue differentiates in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant', 'Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue, formed of more than one cell type, found in vascular plants. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant.', 'Between the xylem and phloem is a meristem called the vascular cambium. This tissue divides off cells that will become additional xylem and phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length. As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth.

96,what is the share of agriculture in indian economy,"In 2020, agriculture accounted for approximately 13.7% of India's GDP, including both value added and gross value.[2] This decline in agricultural GDP share reflects broader economic growth and diversification in India's economy. Understanding this trend helps policymakers assess the need for continued support for rural areas while also focusing on developing other sectors to sustain economic growth.","[""The history of Agriculture in India dates back to Indus Valley Civilization Era and even before that in some parts of Southern India.[1] Today, India ranks second worldwide in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry and fisheries accounted for 13.7% of the GDP (gross domestic product) in 2013,[2] about 50% of the workforce.[3][4] The economic contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining with the country's broad-based economic growth"", ""India ranks second worldwide in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 17% of the GDP and employed 49% of its total workforce in 2014.[143] Agriculture accounted for 23% of GDP, and employed 59% of the country's total workforce in 2016.[144] As the Indian economy has diversified and grown, agriculture's contribution to GDP has steadily declined from 1951 to 2011, yet it is still the country's largest employment source and a significant piece of its overall socio-economic development"", ""India's agricultural economy is undergoing structural changes. Between 1970 and 2011, the GDP share of agriculture has fallen from 43% to 16%. This isn't because of reduced importance of agriculture or a consequence of agricultural policy. This is largely because of the rapid economic growth in services, industrial output, and non-agricultural sectors in India between 2000 and 2010."", ""Historically, India has classified and tracked its economy and GDP in three sectors: agriculture, industry and services. Agriculture includes crops, horticulture, milk and animal husbandry, aquaculture, fishing, sericulture, aviculture, forestry and related activities. Industry includes various manufacturing sub-sectors. India's definition of services sector includes its construction, retail, software, IT, communications, hospitality, infrastructure operations, education, health care, banking and insurance, and many other economic activities.[141][142]\nAgriculture"", '. Still, agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall socio-economic fabric of India.', "". According to the World Bank, India's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity-enhancing investment. Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty, and governmental intervention in labour, land, and credit are hurting the market. Infrastructure such as rural roads, electricity, ports, food storage, retail markets and services remain inadequate.[358] The average size of land holdings is very small, with 70% of holdings being less than one hectare (2.5\xa0acres) in size""]",17.32%
97,when did they stop making pull tabs on beer cans,Beer cans with pull tabs stopped being produced in the United States in the mid-1970s when the push-tab was introduced.,"['. In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr. Fraze had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he later stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab.[4] Pull-tab cans, or the discarded tabs from them, were also called ""pop-tops"" colloquially. In Australia these were colloquially known as ""ring-pull""', 'Beer can pop-top display at a Budweiser Brewery\nEarly metal beverage cans had no tabs; they were opened by a can-piercer or churchkey, a device resembling a bottle opener with a sharp point. The can was opened by punching two triangular holes in the lid—a large one for drinking, and a second (smaller) one to admit air.\nAs early as 1922, inventors were applying for patents on cans with tab tops, but the technology of the time made these inventions impractical.[14] Later advancements saw the ends of the can made out of aluminium instead of steel.', '. Into the 1970s, the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with a significant problem, as people would frequently discard the pull-tabs on the ground as litter, or drop them into the can and risk choking on them. These problems were both addressed by the invention of the ""push-tab"". Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up', 'Mikolaj Kondakow and James Wong of Thunder Bay,[dubious – discuss] Ontario, Canada invented the pull tab version for bottles in or before 1951 (Canadian patent 476789).[16] Then, in 1962, Ermal Cleon Fraze (1913–1989)[17] of Dayton, Ohio, United States, invented the similar integral rivet and pull-tab version (also known as ring pull in British English), which had a ring attached at the rivet for pulling, and which would come off completely to be discarded. He received US Patent No', 'In 1975, Daniel F. Cudzik, an engineer with Reynolds Metals, filed a design patent application for a ""End closure for a container.""[19] This later became known as a ""Sta-Tab."" When the Sta-Tab launched in 1975, on Falls City beer and, quickly, other beverages, there was an initial period of consumer testing and education. Cudzik later received patents for this ""Easy Open Wall"" (US 3967752, issued 1976-07-06\xa0 US 3967753, issued 1976-07-06\xa0). The validity of these patents was upheld in subsequent litigation.[20]', ""History[edit]\nSee also: Tin can §\xa0History\nThe first commercial beer available in cans began in 1935 in Richmond, Virginia.[2] Not long after that, sodas, with their higher acidity and somewhat higher pressures, were available in cans. The key development for storing beverages in cans was the interior liner, typically plastic or sometimes a waxy substance, that helped to keep the product's flavor from being ruined by a chemical reaction with the metal. Another major factor for the timing was the repeal of Prohibition in the United States at the end of 1933.""]",1970s

113,what kind of fish live in the salton sea,"Types of fish species inhabiting the Salton Sea include introduced tilapia, threadfin shad, carp, red shiner, channel catfish, white catfish, largemouth bass, mosquitofish, sailfin molly, and desert pupfish. 

Ecological Roles and Characteristics:
- Tilapia: Main fish tolerant of high salinity and pollution.
- Threadfin shad, carp, red shiner, channel catfish, white catfish, largemouth bass, mosquitofish, sailfin molly: Freshwater fish found in rivers and canals feeding the Salton Sea.
- Desert pupfish: Notable for its ability to withstand rising salinity, surviving salinities from 0.0% to 7.0%.

Introduced tilapia are the main fish that can tolerate the high salinity levels and pollution.

On 18 November 2006, a Ross\'s gull, a high Arctic bird, was sighted and photographed there.[23]', 'The lack of an outflow means the Salton Sea does not have a natural stabilization system; it is very dynamic. Fluctuations in the water level caused by variations in agricultural runoff, the ancient salt deposits in the lake bed, and the relatively high salinity of the inflow feeding the sea are all causing ever-increasing salinity. The body was initially a freshwater lake, but by the 1960s its rising salinity had begun to jeopardize some of the species in it. With a salinity now exceeding 5.0% w/v (saltier than seawater), most species of fish can no longer survive there', 'The Salton Sea had some success as a resort area, with Salton City, Salton Sea Beach, and Desert Shores, on the western shore and Desert Beach, North Shore, and Bombay Beach, built on the eastern shore in the 1950s. However, many of the settlements substantially shrank in size, or have been abandoned, mostly due to the increasing salinity and pollution of the lake over the years from agricultural runoff and other sources. Many of the species of fish that lived in the sea have been killed off by the combination of pollutants, salt levels, and algal blooms', '. A freshwater fish notable for its ability to withstand the rising salinity of the Salton Sea, the desert pupfish, can survive salinities ranging from 0.0% to 7.0%.[24] Fertilizer runoffs have resulted in eutrophication, with large algal blooms and elevated bacterial levels.[25]']",tilapia

133,who did shakespeare write his play hamlet for,"The intended audience for Shakespeare's play Hamlet in the 17th century included mass audiences, as evidenced by its popularity and frequent performances at the Globe theater. However, late 17th-century Restoration critics viewed the play negatively due to its lack of unity and decorum. The cultural context reflects the Protestant tones derived from the setting in Denmark, which was a predominantly Protestant country. The play also references Wittenberg, associated with the Protestant Reformation led by Martin Luther.","['From the early 17th century, the play was famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of melancholy and insanity, leading to a procession of mad courtiers and ladies in Jacobean and Caroline drama.[70][71] Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century Restoration critics saw Hamlet as primitive and disapproved of its lack of unity and decorum.[72][73] This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances', '.[38] Katherine Duncan-Jones accepts a 1600–1 attribution for the date Hamlet was written, but notes that the Lord Chamberlain\'s Men, playing Hamlet in the 3000-capacity Globe, were unlikely to be put to any disadvantage by an audience of ""barely one hundred"" for the Children of the Chapel\'s equivalent play, Antonio\'s Revenge; she believes that Shakespeare, confident in the superiority of his own work, was making a playful and charitable allusion to his friend John Marston\'s very similar piece.[44]', 'Hamlet is Shakespeare\'s longest play, and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature, with a story capable of ""seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others"".[1] It was probably one of Shakespeare\'s most popular works during his lifetime,[2] and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879', ""Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range.[136][137][p] Judging by the number of reprints, Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only Henry IV Part 1, Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it.[2] Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.[141]"", ""The play was revived early in the Restoration. When the existing stock of pre-civil war plays was divided between the two newly created patent theatre companies, Hamlet was the only Shakespearean favourite that Sir William Davenant's Duke's Company secured.[149] It became the first of Shakespeare's plays to be presented with movable flats painted with generic scenery behind the proscenium arch of Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre"", ""Much of the play's Protestant tones derive from its setting in Denmark—both then and now a predominantly Protestant country,[l] though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to portray this implicit fact.

This means the offspring will inherit traits from both the sperm cell and the egg cell, including the specific genetic trait carried by the egg cell. [1][2]","['The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum. The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation, follows with ovulation, and finishes with fertilization. Various exceptions to this sequence are possible, including artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, external ejaculation without copulation, or copulation shortly after ovulation.[2][3][4] Upon encountering the secondary oocyte, the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg', 'Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century.[1]', '. The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg.[10]', 'Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell, facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells. As a population, sperm cells have on average 50% genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort.[7] It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection.\nRecent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process.[8][9]\nCortical reaction[edit]', 'A gamete (from Ancient Greek γαμετή gamete from gamein ""to marry""[1]) is a haploid cell that fuses with another haploid cell during fertilization (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum (or egg)—and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type—called a sperm. In short a gamete is an egg (female gamete) or a sperm (male gamete)', 'Anatomy[edit]\nCorona radiata[edit]\nThe sperm binds through the corona radiata, a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte. Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell, known as zygote. The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism.\nCone of attraction and perivitelline membrane[edit]']",No answer

These included: the interconnectedness of all living systems in a single living planetary system, the biosphere; the importance of natural cycles (of water, nutrients and other chemicals, materials, waste); and the passage of energy through trophic levels of living systems.[31]\nMid 20th century: environmentalism[edit]\nSee also: Environmentalism and Environmental science', "". The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity, presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s.[38][39] Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small-scale sustainability policies.[40]"", 'Environmental problems were now becoming global in scale.[6][7][8][9] The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on a nonrenewable resource; President Carter in his State of the Union Address called on Americans to ""Conserve energy. Eliminate waste.

In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations.[7] A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling, and renewable energies emerged', '. A plethora of new concepts to help implement and measure sustainability are becoming more widely accepted including the car-free movement, smart growth (more sustainable urban environments), life cycle assessment (the cradle to cradle analysis of resource use and environmental impact over the life cycle of a product or process), ecological footprint analysis, green building, dematerialization (increased recycling of materials), decarbonisation (removing dependence on fossil fuels) and much more.[44]']",1987

173,what is the role of hcl in the stomach,"Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach plays a key role in digestion by creating a highly acidic environment that denatures proteins, exposing their peptide bonds. This allows digestive enzymes like pepsin to break down proteins into smaller amino acids through proteolysis. Additionally, HCl helps inhibit microbial growth, preventing infections. Reference: [1], [7].","['The main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid which is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the gastric glands in the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5[1] in the human stomach lumen, the acidity being maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase', 'Gastric acid, gastric juice or stomach acid, is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids. Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed', 'The role of gastric acid in digestion was established in the 1820s and 1830s by William Beaumont on Alexis St. Martin, who, as a result of an accident, had a fistula (hole) in his stomach, which allowed Beaumont to observe the process of digestion and to extract gastric acid, verifying that acid played a crucial role in digestion.[7]\nSee also[edit]\nStomach\nDigestion\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\nDiscovery and development of proton pump inhibitors\nReferences[edit]\nJump up ^ Marieb EN, Hoehn K (2010). Human anatomy & physiology. San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings. ISBN\xa00-8053-9591-1.', '8 References\n9 External links\nSecretion[edit]\nA typical adult human stomach will secrete about 1.5 liters of gastric acid daily.[2] Gastric acid secretion happens in several steps. Chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi. Gastric acid is then secreted into the lumen of the gastric gland and gradually reaches the main stomach lumen.[2] The exact manner in which the secreted acid reaches the stomach lumen is controversial, as acid must first cross the relatively pH neutral gastric mucus layer.', ""The highly acidic environment in the stomach lumen causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure (or denature). This exposes the protein's peptide bonds. The gastric chief cells of the stomach secrete enzymes for protein breakdown (inactive pepsinogen, and in infancy rennin). Hydrochloric acid activates pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin, which then helps digestion by breaking the bonds linking amino acids, a process known as proteolysis. In addition, many microorganisms have their growth inhibited by such an acidic environment, which is helpful to prevent infection."", 'The stomach is a major organ of the gastrointestinal tract and digestive system. It is a consistently J-shaped organ joined to the esophagus at its upper end and to the duodenum at its lower end. Gastric acid (informally gastric juice), produced in the stomach plays a vital role in the digestive process, and mainly contains hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride. A peptide hormone, gastrin, produced by G cells in the gastric glands, stimulates the production of gastric juice which activates the digestive enzymes']","plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids"

It consists of a trilogy of storylines that ran from 1993 to 1994, consisting of ""Knightfall"", ""Knightquest"", and ""KnightsEnd"".[note 1] The story takes place over approximately six months. Bruce Wayne (Batman) suffers burnout and is systematically assaulted and crippled by a ""super steroid""-enhanced genius named Bane. Wayne is replaced as Batman by an apprentice named Jean-Paul Valley (a.k.a. Azrael), who becomes increasingly violent and unstable, tarnishing Batman\'s reputation', '. By this time, Batman is so exhausted from the exertion of catching the escaped criminals that he cannot even defend himself; Bane beats him mercilessly before breaking Wayne\'s back over his knee inside the Batcave below the manor, symbolically ""breaking"" Batman.[4] Bane takes the grievously-wounded Wayne (still costumed in the Batman outfit) downtown to Gotham Square and throws him from a rooftop to demonstrate his superiority to the populace.

Tim Drake argues with Bruce to allow Dick Grayson (the former Robin and then-current Nightwing) to become Batman, as he is more experienced and mentally competent. Bruce replies that Grayson has his own responsibilities and would only take up the mantle of the Bat reluctantly (Dick later expressed resentment at not being asked to stand in as Batman)', '.

The exception was the taste of wine made from native grapes, which they did not like.","["". It was the only practical way for settlers in wagons without tools, livestock, or supplies to cross the mountains and usually thought critical to the colonization of the American West. Some of the first to travel the Oregon Trail were Christian missionaries, members of the Methodist Episcopal Church who established the Methodist Mission in 1834. Even though they didn't make many converts, they were impressed by the short amount of time needed to reach the Pacific Coast. Rumors about how the sun always shone there and wheat grew as tall as a man attracted American settlers."", '. Settlers emigrating from the eastern United States were spurred by various motives, among them religious persecution, economic incentives, and the prospect of new wealth and new freedoms in what was then a largely unspoiled and unregulated country. By the 1840s, several popular and well-established routes had been blazed through the continental interior to destinations in the far west, including the Oregon Trail, California Trail, and Mormon Trail. After the end of the Mexican–American War in 1849, vast new American conquests again enticed mass immigration', '. In Oregon, sheep were slaughtered and left to the buzzards because meat prices were not sufficient to warrant transportation to markets.[51]', 'American settlers began following the trail in 1841, with the first recorded colonist wagon traingroup being the 1843 ""Great Migration"" of about 900 colonists, led by Marcus Whitman. The Provisional Government of Oregon was established by such colonists in 1843, generally limited to the Willamette Valley. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 divided the Oregon Country between Great Britain and the United States, mostly along the 49th parallel. The Territory of Oregon was established shortly afterwards, in 1848, and over 12,000 American settlers made the journey there during the decade.', 'The most common vehicle for Oregon and California-bound settlers was a covered wagon pulled by a team of oxen or mules (which were greatly preferred for their endurance and strength over horses) in the dry semi-arid terrain common to the high plains in the heat of summer. In later years, following the advice of Brigham Young, many Mormon emigrants made the crossing to Utah with handcarts', '.

199,when was the defensive 3 second rule implemented,The defensive 3-second rule was implemented in the NBA during the 2001–2002 season.,"['A defensive three-second violation, also known as illegal defense, is a basketball rules infraction in the National Basketball Association (NBA) introduced in the 2001–2002 season. It is assessed when a member of the defending team spends more than three seconds in the free throw lane (also known as the 16-foot lane, or colloquially as ""in the paint"") while not actively guarding an opponent. To be considered actively guarding, a defender must be within arm\'s length of an opponent and in a guarding position.[1] A three-second count is suspended if:[2][clarification needed]', 'Prior to the 2001–2002 NBA season, any form of zone defense was considered an illegal defense violation and resulted in a warning on the first violation and then a technical foul for any subsequent violations.[5] However, the defensive three-second violation makes it difficult for NBA defenses to play zone, since zone defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration.[6] The Philippine Basketball Association used to follow the illegal defense rule until the 2003 PBA season when it was abolished', 'a player is in the act of shooting\nthere is a loss of team control\nthe defender is actively guarding an opponent\nthe defender clears the painted area\nit is imminent the defender will become legal\nIn addition, a player guarding an opponent with the ball may be in the paint without actively guarding the opponent.[3]\nThe team committing a defensive three-second violation is assessed a team technical foul.

This move by the NBA aims for fewer ""back-to-back"" games, even fewer than the previous season which had already reached an all-time low to help address teams that are ""resting"" their superstars.[1]\nThe NBA decreased the maximum number of timeouts in a regulation game from 18 to 14. The three team timeouts during the last two minutes of the game were also decreased to two per team in the last three minutes to improve the flow and pace of the game.[118]']",in the 2001–2002 season
200,where does the optic nerve cross the midline ​,"The optic nerve crosses the midline in the human brain at the optic chiasm, located immediately below the hypothalamus.","['[edit on Wikidata]\nThe optic chiasm or optic chiasma ( /ɒptɪk kaɪæzəm/; Greek χίασμα, ""crossing"", from the Greek χιάζω \'to mark with an X\', after the Greek letter \'Χ\', chi) is the part of the brain where the optic nerves partially cross. The optic chiasm is located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus.[1] The optic chiasm is found in all vertebrates, although in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) it is located within the brain.[2][3]\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Structure\n2 Other animals\n3 Additional images\n4 History\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nStructure[edit]', 'The optic nerve is a central tract of many axons of ganglion cells connecting primarily to the lateral geniculate body, a visual relay station in the diencephalon (the rear of the forebrain). It also projects to the superior colliculus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the nucleus of the optic tract. It passes through the other layers, creating the optic disc in primates.[10]', '. The net result of optic nerve crossing over at the optic chiasm is for the right cerebral hemisphere to sense and process left hemispheric vision, and for the left cerebral hemisphere to sense and process right hemispheric vision.[4]', '6 References\n7 External links\nStructure[edit]\nThe optic nerve fibres on the nasal sides of each retina cross over (decussate) to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm (decussation of medial fibers). The temporal hemiretina, on the other hand, stays on the same side. The inferonasal retina are related to anterior portion of the optic chiasm whereas superonasal retinal fibers are related to the posterior portion of the optic chiasm.', 'This crossing is an adaptive feature of frontally oriented eyes, found mostly in predatory animals requiring precise visual depth perception. (Prey animals, with laterally positioned eyes, have little binocular vision, so there is a more complete crossover of visual signals[citation needed].) Beyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, the optic nerves become optic tracts. The signals are passed on to the lateral geniculate body, in turn giving them to the occipital cortex (the outer matter of the rear brain).[5]\nOther animals[edit]', 'Other animals[edit]\nIn Siamese cats with certain genotypes of the albino gene, this wiring is disrupted, with more of the nerve-crossing than is normal, as a number of scholars have reported.[6] To compensate for lack of crossing in their brains, they cross their eyes (strabismus).[7]\nThis is also seen in albino tigers, as Guillery & Kaas report.[8]\nAdditional images[edit]\nScheme showing central connections of the optic nerves and optic tracts.\nBase of brain.\n3D schematic representation of optic tracts\nTransformations of the visual field toward the visual map on the primary visual cortex.']",optic chiasm
