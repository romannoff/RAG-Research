(Source: Context provided)","['Motor systems are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain.[7] Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming', 'In consequence:\nthe motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic (involving only one motor neuron, respectively, somatic and branchial, which synapses onto the muscle).\nthe command of visceral muscles is disynaptic (involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron located in the CNS, which synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle).', 'A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.[1] There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons', 'Somatic motor neurons[edit]\nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles [14] (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons, beta efferent neurons, and gamma efferent neurons. They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.', 'Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the main force-generating component of a muscle. Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called ventral horn cells.

One of the many hypotheses for ""causes"" of the Cambrian explosion is the ""Light Switch"" theory of Andrew Parker: It holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution.[11] Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision.', 'He suggested a stepwise evolution from ""an optic nerve merely coated with pigment, and without any other mechanism"" to ""a moderately high stage of perfection"", and gave examples of existing intermediate steps.[5] Darwin\'s suggestions were soon shown to be correct, and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution.[6]', 'The evolution of the eye is attractive to study, because the eye distinctively exemplifies an analogous organ found in many animal forms. Complex, image-forming eyes have evolved independently several times.[1] The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion.

The term ""gymnosperm"" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, ""naked"" and σπέρμα sperma, ""seed""), meaning ""naked seeds"". The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary', 'Gymnosperms, like all vascular plants, have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle, which means they spend most of their life cycle with diploid cells, while the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived. Two spore types, microspores and megaspores, are typically produced in pollen cones or ovulate cones, respectively. Gametophytes, as with all heterosporous plants, develop within the spore wall. Pollen grains (microgametophytes) mature from microspores, and ultimately produce sperm cells. Megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule', '. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat.[16]']",either on the surface of scales or leaves

According to MeSH, dantrolene is usually classified as a centrally acting muscle relaxant.[10] The World Health Organization, in its ATC, uses the term ""centrally acting agents"",[11] but adds a distinct category of ""directly acting agents"", for dantrolene.[12] Use of this terminology dates back to at least 1973.[13]\nThe term ""spasmolytic"" is also considered a synonym for antispasmodic.[14]\nClinical use[edit]', 'Terminology[edit]\nBecause they may act at the level of the cortex, brain stem or spinal cord, or all three areas, they have traditionally been referred to as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants. However, it is now known not every agent in this class has CNS activity (e.g. dantrolene), so this name is inaccurate.[5]']",to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions

The magazine Scientific American corroborated the technical aspect of this question, while leaving out the philosophic side, a year later when they asked the question slightly reworded, ""If a tree were to fall on an uninhabited island, would there be any sound?"" And gave a more technical answer, ""Sound is vibration, transmitted to our senses through the mechanism of the ear, and recognized as sound only at our nerve centers. The falling of the tree or any other disturbance will produce vibration of the air. If there be no ears to hear, there will be no sound.""[5]', 'Some years later, a similar question is posed. It is unknown whether the source of this question is Berkeley or not. In June 1883 in the magazine The Chautauquan, the question was put, ""If a tree were to fall on an island where there were no human beings would there be any sound?"" They then went on to answer the query with, ""No. Sound is the sensation excited in the ear when the air or other medium is set in motion.""[4] This seems to imply that the question is posed not from a philosophical viewpoint, but from a purely scientific one', 'Philosopher George Berkeley, in his work, A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710), proposes, ""But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park [...] and nobody by to perceive them.[1] [...] The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden [...] no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them.""[2] (It is worth noting that the quote from section 45 is arguably a statement of an objection to Berkeley\'s view, and not a proclamation of it']",Charles Riborg Mann

Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato-growing states in the United States are also major hops-producing areas;[16] however, not all potato-growing areas can produce good hops naturally: soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, for example, lack the boron that hops prefer.[16] Historically, hops were not grown in Ireland, but were imported from England"", 'Although hops are grown in most of the continental United States and Canada,[23] cultivation of hops for commercial production requires a particular environment. As hops are a climbing plant, they are trained to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same sunlight profile. In this way, energy that would have been required to build structural cells is also freed for crop growth.[24][citation needed]', ""Hop cultivation was begun in the present-day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers.[13] Before prohibition, cultivation was mainly centred around New York, California, Oregon, and Washington state.

John Madden, who appeared on television for the NFL Thanksgiving Day game from 1981 to 2001, frequently advocated his fondness for the turducken, deboned turkey, duck and chicken nested inside each other then cooked.[13] In a few areas of the West Coast of the United States, Dungeness crab is common as an alternate main dish, as crab season starts in early November. Similarly, Thanksgiving falls within deer hunting season in the Northeastern United States, which encourages the use of venison as a centerpiece', 'According to what traditionally is known as ""The First Thanksgiving,"" the 1621 feast between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony contained waterfowl, venison, ham, lobster, clams, berries, fruit, pumpkin, and squash.

179,who is the book of galatians written to,The Book of Galatians is written to the churches of Galatia.,"['Revelation\nNew Testament manuscripts\nv\nt\ne\nThe Epistle to the Galatians, often shortened to Galatians, is the ninth book of the New Testament. It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Scholars have suggested that this is either the Roman province of Galatia in southern Anatolia, or a large region defined by an ethnic group of Celtic people in central Anatolia.[1]', 'South Galatian view[edit]\nThe South Galatian view holds that Paul wrote Galatians before or shortly after the First Jerusalem Council, probably on his way to it, and that it was written to churches he had presumably planted during either his time in Tarsus (he would have traveled a short distance, since Tarsus is in Cilicia) after his first visit to Jerusalem as a Christian,[14] or during his first missionary journey, when he traveled throughout southern Galatia. If it was written to the believers in South Galatia, it would likely have been written in 49.[15]\nEarliest epistle[edit]', 'Paul\'s letter is addressed ""to the churches of Galatia"" (Galatians 1:2), but the location of these churches is a matter of debate. A minority of scholars have argued that the ""Galatia"" is an ethnic reference to a Celtic people living in northern Asia Minor, but most agree that it is a geographical reference to the Roman province in central Asia Minor, which had been settled by immigrant Celts in the 270s BC and retained Gaulish features of culture and language in Paul\'s day', 'Epistle to the Galatians - Wikipedia\n \nEpistle to the Galatians \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nPart of a series of articles on\nPaul in the Bible\nPauline literature\xa0[show]\nRomans\nI Corinthians\nII Corinthians\nGalatians\nEphesians\nPhilippians\nColossians\nI Thessalonians\nII Thessalonians\nPastoral epistles\nI Timothy\nII Timothy\nTitus\nPhilemon\nHebrews\nAuthorship\xa0[show]\nPaul the Apostle\nRelated literature\xa0[show]\nLost epistles\nApocalypse of Paul\nCoptic Apocalypse of Paul\nCorinthians to Paul\nActs of Paul\nPaul and Thecla\nPeter and Paul\nPrayer of Paul']",a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia

181,how did rogue get super strength and flight,"Rogue gained super strength and flight by absorbing the superhuman powers and psyche of Carol Danvers, the original Ms. Marvel, and later Wonder Man. These absorptions granted her superhuman strength, stamina, durability, reflexes, speed, and the ability to fly. Additionally, during the Maximum Security miniseries, she absorbed an injured Cadre K girl named Z'Cann, who had a fluid Skrull physiology, enabling her to recall previously absorbed powers. 
Sources: [13], [101].","['Ms. Marvel powers[edit]\nAs a young woman, Rogue permanently absorbed the superhuman powers and the psyche of Carol Danvers, the original Ms. Marvel.[13] This provided her with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, reflexes, speed and a 7th sense. She was able to repel bullets and fly at sub-sonic speeds, much like Ms. Marvel could. In addition, she possessed an amalgamated mutant human/Kree physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons, with the added effect of making her virtually invulnerable.[101]', ""Rogue currently possesses Wonder Man's essence, including his powers and psyche. Her organic tissues have been permeated with ionic energy, granting her an array of superhuman abilities. She possesses superhuman strength sufficient enough to lift well over 100 tons, as well as some degree of superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes. In addition, Rogue is virtually invulnerable to damage and is capable of flying at high speeds. Rogue's eyes glow in darkness and her vision extends somewhat into the infrared spectrum, allowing her to see in the dark"", ""In the short-lived volume three of her self-entitield series (2004–2005), Rogue absorbed a large portion of the mutant Sunfire's solar-absorption based powers. In addition to her own natural mutant abilities Rogue could then project intense heat and flame, envelop her body in a fiery aura, fly by focusing her power downwards in a tight stream to propel her like a rocket, focus her power inward to increase her strength (though not at her Ms. Marvel levels), exercise immunity to heat and radiation, and see the infra-red spectrum"", ""During the Maximum Security miniseries, Rogue absorbed an injured Cadre K girl named Z'Cann. The girl held on longer than necessary, using her mind control to boost the process and because of this (perhaps because she had absorbed a fluid Skrull physiology) Rogue mutated further, gaining the ability to 'recall' the powers of anyone she had ever absorbed before, though she could not control when or which of these powers surfaced"", 'Rogue possesses the mutant ability to absorb the psyche and abilities of another human being (or members of some sapient alien races) through skin contact. Rogue can absorb the memories, knowledge, talents, personality and physical abilities (whether superhuman or not) of the person she touches, as well as occasionally duplicating in herself physical characteristics of her victim. The victim loses those abilities and memories for exactly the amount of time that Rogue possesses them. This absorption usually leaves the victim weakened and sometimes renders them unconscious']","Rogue permanently absorbed the superhuman powers and the psyche of Carol Danvers, the original Ms. Marvel"

Therefore, growth need not take place in a balanced way', 'Hirschman contends that deliberate unbalancing of the economy according to the strategy is the best method of development and if the economy is to be kept moving ahead, the task of development policy is to maintain tension, disproportions and disequilibrium. Balanced growth should not be the goal but rather the maintenance of existing imbalances, which can be seen from profit and losses.

Tim Drake argues with Bruce to allow Dick Grayson (the former Robin and then-current Nightwing) to become Batman, as he is more experienced and mentally competent. Bruce replies that Grayson has his own responsibilities and would only take up the mantle of the Bat reluctantly (Dick later expressed resentment at not being asked to stand in as Batman)', '. By this time, Batman is so exhausted from the exertion of catching the escaped criminals that he cannot even defend himself; Bane beats him mercilessly before breaking Wayne\'s back over his knee inside the Batcave below the manor, symbolically ""breaking"" Batman.[4] Bane takes the grievously-wounded Wayne (still costumed in the Batman outfit) downtown to Gotham Square and throws him from a rooftop to demonstrate his superiority to the populace.

Similar stories followed for Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Green Arrow, with Green Lantern Hal Jordan being driven insane and replaced with Kyle Rayner, a new Wonder Woman being appointed by Hippolyta, Aquaman losing his hand, and Green Arrow dying in a plane crash as his long-lost son took over the role.']",Jean-Paul Valley (a.k.a.

The temporal hemiretina, on the other hand, stays on the same side. The inferonasal retina are related to anterior portion of the optic chiasm whereas superonasal retinal fibers are related to the posterior portion of the optic chiasm.', 'This crossing is an adaptive feature of frontally oriented eyes, found mostly in predatory animals requiring precise visual depth perception. (Prey animals, with laterally positioned eyes, have little binocular vision, so there is a more complete crossover of visual signals[citation needed].) Beyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, the optic nerves become optic tracts. The signals are passed on to the lateral geniculate body, in turn giving them to the occipital cortex (the outer matter of the rear brain).[5]\nOther animals[edit]', '6 External links\nMiddle part[edit]\nThe middle part of the fossa presents, in front, the chiasmatic groove and tuberculum sellae; the chiasmatic groove ends on either side at the optic foramen, which transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery to the orbital cavity.\nBehind the optic foramen the anterior clinoid process is directed backward and medialward and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli.']",optic chiasm
