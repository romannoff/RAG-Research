0,all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are,All the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are located in the spinal cord and hindbrain. These motor neurons are known as lower motor neurons and they directly activate skeletal muscles. [7],"['Motor systems are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain.[7] Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming', 'Major areas involved in controlling movement\nArea\nLocation\nFunction\nVentral horn\nSpinal cord\nContains motor neurons that directly activate muscles[84]\nOculomotor nuclei\nMidbrain\nContains motor neurons that directly activate the eye muscles[85]\nCerebellum\nHindbrain\nCalibrates precision and timing of movements[7]\nBasal ganglia\nForebrain\nAction selection on the basis of motivation[86]\nMotor cortex\nFrontal lobe\nDirect cortical activation of spinal motor circuits\nPremotor cortex\nFrontal lobe\nGroups elementary movements into coordinated patterns[7]\nSupplementary motor area\nFrontal lobe', 'Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the main force-generating component of a muscle. Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called ventral horn cells. A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average.[15] The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. Motor units are split up into 3 categories:[16] Main Article: Motor Unit', 'A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.[1] There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons', 'In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. This process is also called the stretch reflex.', 'The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe', 'Somatic motor neurons[edit]\nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles [14] (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons, beta efferent neurons, and gamma efferent neurons. They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.', '.[2] The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors.[3] Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.', 'Upper motor neurons[edit]\nUpper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. The axons of these cells descend from the cortex to form the corticospinal tract.[10]\nWhite Matter Tract[edit]', 'Lateral Corticospinal Tract\nRubrospinal Tract\nLateral Reticulospinal Tract\nVestibulospinal tract\nMedial Reticulospinal Tract\nTectospinal Tract\nAnterior Corticospinal Tract\nLower Motor Neurons[edit]\nLower motor neurons are those that originate in the spinal cord and directly or indirectly innervate effector targets.

The cadets live and breathe the phrase ""Beat Navy!"" while for midshipmen the opposite phrase, ""Beat Army!"" is ingrained. They have become a symbol of competitiveness, not just in the Army–Navy Game, but in the service of their country, and are often used at the close of (informal) letters by graduates of both academies.

In 1965–1966, India fought a War with Pakistan. There was also a severe drought in 1965. The war led to inflation and the priority was shifted to price stabilisation. The construction of dams continued. Many cement and fertilizer plants were also built. Punjab began producing an abundance of wheat.', 'The First Five-Year Plan was one of the most important because it had a great role in the launching of Indian development after Independence. Thus, it strongly supported agriculture production and it also launched the industrialization of the country (but less than the Second Plan, which focused on heavy industries). It built a particular system of mixed economy, with a great role for the public sector (with an emerging welfare state), as well as a growing private sector (represented by some personalities as those who published the Bombay Plan).\nFirst Plan (1951–1956)[edit]', 'The total amount allocated under the Second Five-Year Plan in India was Rs.48\xa0billion. This amount was allocated among various sectors: power and irrigation, social services, communications and transport, and miscellaneous.\n""The target growth rate was 4.5% and the actual growth rate was 4.27%.[6]""\nThird Plan (1961–1966)[edit]', '. The main disadvantage of this plan is that if the targets are revised each year, it becomes very difficult to achieve them which are laid down in the five-year period and it turned out to be a complex plan. Frequent revisions resulted in lack of stability in the economy which is essential for its balanced development and progress.', 'Due to miserable failure of the Third Plan the government was forced to declare ""plan holidays"" (from 1966–67, 1967–68, and 1968–69). Three annual plans were drawn during this intervening period. During 1966–67 there was again the problem of drought. Equal priority was given to agriculture, its allied activities, and industrial sector. The government of India declared ""Devaluation of Rupee"" to increase the exports of the country. The main reasons for plan holidays were the war, lack of resources, and increase in inflation after that plan holiday was created.\nFourth Plan (1969–1974)[edit]', ""Family planning was also expanded in order to prevent overpopulation. In contrast to China's strict and binding one-child policy, Indian policy did not rely on the threat of force[citation needed]. More prosperous areas of India adopted family planning more rapidly than less prosperous areas, which continued to have a high birth rate.\nThe Sixth Five-Year Plan was a great success to the Indian economy.

The First Plan is for the present year which comprises the annual budget and Second is a plan for a fixed number of years, which may be 3, 4 or 5 years. Plan number two is kept changing as per the requirements of the Indian economy. The Third Plan is a perspective plan which is for long terms i.e', '. The Attack of 1965 was successfully stopped and ceasefire was negotiated under international pressure.[92] In the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 India won a clear victory, resulting in liberation of Bangladesh (formerly East-Pakistan).[93][94]', 'Indian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial experience, which was seen as exploitative by Indian leaders exposed to British social democracy and the planned economy of the Soviet Union.[108] Domestic policy tended towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialisation, economic interventionism, a large government-run public sector, business regulation, and central planning,[116] while trade and foreign investment policies were relatively liberal.[117] Five-Year Plans of India resembled central planning in the Soviet Union', 'The target growth rate was 5.6%, but the actual growth rate was 3.3%.[6]\nFifth Plan (1974–1978)[edit]\nThe Fifth Five-Year Plan laid stress on employment, poverty alleviation (Garibi Hatao), and justice. The plan also focused on self-reliance in agricultural production and defence. In 1978 the newly elected Morarji Desai government rejected the plan. The Electricity Supply Act was amended in 1975, which enabled the central government to enter into power generation and transmission.[7][citation needed]']",The Third Five-year Plan

6,what is the first step in the evolution of the eye,"The first step in the evolution of the eye was the development of photoreceptor proteins that sense light, known as ""eyespots,"" found in unicellular organisms. These eyespots could only sense ambient brightness, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms, but not enough to distinguish shapes or determine the direction of light.","['Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye. All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development. This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light-sensitive machinery – even if it was not a dedicated optical organ. However, even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells. Probably, photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion', 'Early eyes[edit]\nThe basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein, surrounding the chromophore, a pigment that distinguishes colors. Groups of such cells are termed ""eyespots"", and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a very basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings.[22]', 'See also[edit]\nOcelloid\nReferences[edit]\nJump up ^ """"An important cue for understanding eye evolution is the distinction between different types of photoreceptor cells. Salvini-Plawen and Mayr ( 1977 ) noted a remarkable diversity of photoreceptor cell morphology across the animal kingdom, and suggested that photoreceptors evolved independently numerous times."" - Land, M.F. and Nilsson, D.-E., Animal Eyes(2-nd ed.), Oxford University Press, Oxford (2012), p. 7.', 'The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called ""eyespots"". Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They are insufficient for vision, as they cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from. Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups, and are common among unicellular organisms, including euglena', 'The functional unit of the eye is the photoreceptor cell, which contains the opsin proteins and responds to light by initiating a nerve impulse. The light sensitive opsins are borne on a hairy layer, to maximise the surface area. The nature of these ""hairs"" differs, with two basic forms underlying photoreceptor structure: microvilli and cilia.[23] In the eyes of protostomes, they are microvilli: extensions or protrusions of the cellular membrane. But in the eyes of deuterostomes, they are derived from cilia, which are separate structures', 'It is likely that a key reason eyes specialize in detecting a specific, narrow range of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum—the visible spectrum—is because the earliest species to develop photosensitivity were aquatic, and only two specific wavelength ranges of electromagnetic radiation, blue and green visible light, can travel through water. This same light-filtering property of water also influenced the photosensitivity of plants.[31][32][33]\nLens formation and diversification[edit]\nLight from a distant object and a near object being focused by changing the curvature of the lens', 'The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate, because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals', 'The eyes of many animals record their evolutionary history in their contemporary anatomy. The vertebrate eye, for instance, is built ""backwards and upside down"", requiring ""photons of light to travel through the cornea, lens, aqueous fluid, blood vessels, ganglion cells, amacrine cells, horizontal cells, and bipolar cells before they reach the light-sensitive rods and cones that transduce the light signal into neural impulses, which are then sent to the visual cortex at the back of the brain for processing into meaningful patterns', "". Many examples of wavelength-specific behaviors have been identified, in two primary groups: Below 450\xa0nm, associated with direct light, and above 450\xa0nm, associated with reflected light.[40] As opsin molecules were tuned to detect different wavelengths of light, at some point color vision developed when the photoreceptor cells used differently tuned opsins.[26] This may have happened at any of the early stages of the eye's evolution, and may have disappeared and reevolved as organisms became predator or prey"", 'This suggests that when the two lineages diverged in the Precambrian, they had only very primitive light receptors, which developed into more complex eyes independently.\nEarly eyes[edit]']",photoreceptor proteins that sense light

The first day of the new year is passionately celebrated in a historical carnival that takes place every year in Bhaktapur, called Bisket Jatra.As before, from 2007 AD Nepal Sambat is recognized as the national calender.', ""In India, the reformulated Saka Calendar is officially used (although not for computing the dates of the traditional festivals), although in the Hindi version of the Preamble of the Constitution of India, the date of adoption of the constitution, 26 November 1949, is presented in Vikram Samvat (Margsheersh Shukla Saptami Samvat 2006).

During the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used in high society in France till the end of the Ancien Régime. The earliest of which mention has been found belonged to Charles the Bold. They had curtains over a light framework, and were in their way as fine as the stationary beds.', 'In the 15th century beds became very large, reaching 7 to 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4\xa0m) by 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1\xa0m). The mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks, straw, or feathers. At this time great personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property about with them, including beds and bed-hangings, and for this reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks to be covered up; but about the beginning of the 16th century bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative, since the lords remained in the same place for longer periods.\nRenaissance and modern Europe', 'Napoleon I\'s bed\nIn the 18th century feather pillows were first used as coverings in Germany, which in the fashions of the bed and the curious etiquette connected with the bedchamber followed France for the most part. The beds were a la duchesse, but in France itself there was great variety both of name and shape. The custom of the ""bed of justice"" upon which the king of France reclined when he was present in parliament, the princes being seated, the great officials standing, and the lesser officials kneeling, was held to denote the royal power even more than the throne.', 'In the 12th century, luxury increased and bedsteads were made of wood much decorated with inlaid, carved, and painted ornamentation. They also used folding beds, which served as couches by day and had cushions covered with silk laid upon leather. At night a linen sheet was spread and pillows placed, while silk-covered skins served as coverlets. The Carolingian manuscripts show metal bedsteads much higher at the head than at the feet, and this shape continued in use until the 13th century in France, many cushions being added to raise the body to a sloping position', '. The space between bed and wall was called the ruelle, and very intimate friends were received there. The 14th century is also the time when feather beds became highly prized possessions.[8]', ""Iron beds appear in the 18th century; the advertisements declare them as free from the insects which sometimes infested wooden bedsteads. Elsewhere, there was also the closed bed with sliding or folding shutters, and in England—where beds were commonly quite simple in form—the four poster was the usual citizen's bed until the middle of the 19th century.\nBed sizes\nMain article: Bed size"", ""Medieval Europe\nThe ancient Germans lay on the floor on beds of leaves covered with skins, or in a kind of shallow chest filled with leaves and moss. In the early Middle Ages they laid carpets on the floor or on a bench against the wall, placed upon them mattresses stuffed with feathers, wool, or hair, and used skins as a covering. Curtains were hung from the ceiling or from an iron arm projecting from the wall.[8] They appear to have generally lain naked in bed, wrapping themselves in large linen sheets which were stretched over the cushions.\nSouthampton Medieval Merchant's House bedroom"", 'In the 14th century the woodwork became of less importance, generally being entirely covered by hangings of rich materials. Silk, velvet, and even cloth of gold were frequently used. Inventories from the beginning of the 14th century give details of these hangings lined with fur and richly embroidered. It was then that the Four poster bed (also known as a tester bed) made its first appearance, the bed being slung from the ceiling or fastened to the walls, a form which developed later into a room within a room, shut in by double curtains, sometimes even to exclude all drafts', 'In the 17th century, which has been called ""the century of magnificent beds"", the style a la duchesse, with tester and curtains only at the head, replaced the more enclosed beds in France, though they lasted much longer in England. Louis XIV had an enormous number of sumptuous beds, as many as 413 being described in the inventories of his palaces. Some of them had embroideries enriched with pearls, and figures on a silver or golden ground. The great bed at Versailles had crimson velvet curtains on which ""The Triumph of Venus"" was embroidered', '.[4] The Egyptians had high bedsteads which were ascended by steps, with bolsters or pillows, and curtains to hang around. The elite of Egyptian society such as its pharaohs and queens even had beds made of wood, sometimes gilded. Often there was a head-rest as well, semi-cylindrical and made of stone, wood, or metal. Ancient Assyrians, Medes, and Persians had beds of a similar kind, and frequently decorated their furniture with inlays or appliques of metal, mother-of-pearl, and ivory.']",the 12th century

17,the seed of a gymnosperm seed is made in the,The seed of a gymnosperm seed is made in the ovule.,"['. Gymnosperms produce multiple archegonia, which produce the female gamete. During pollination, pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from the pollen cone to the ovule. Pollen is usually moved by wind or insects. Whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle. The pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms', 'The gymnosperms are a group of seed-producing plants that includes conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes. The term ""gymnosperm"" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, ""naked"" and σπέρμα sperma, ""seed""), meaning ""naked seeds"". The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary', '. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or solitary as in Yew, Torreya, Ginkgo.[1]', 'Gymnosperms, like all vascular plants, have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle, which means they spend most of their life cycle with diploid cells, while the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived. Two spore types, microspores and megaspores, are typically produced in pollen cones or ovulate cones, respectively. Gametophytes, as with all heterosporous plants, develop within the spore wall. Pollen grains (microgametophytes) mature from microspores, and ultimately produce sperm cells. Megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule', '. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat.[16]', 'The gymnosperms and angiosperms together compose the spermatophytes or seed plants. The gymnosperms are divided into six phyla. Organisms that belong to the Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Gnetophyta, and Pinophyta (also known as Coniferophyta) phyla are still in existence while those in the Pteridospermales and Cordaitales phyla are now extinct.[2]', 'The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum. The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation, follows with ovulation, and finishes with fertilization. Various exceptions to this sequence are possible, including artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, external ejaculation without copulation, or copulation shortly after ovulation.[2][3][4] Upon encountering the secondary oocyte, the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg', 'In early classification schemes, the gymnosperms (Gymnospermae) were regarded as a ""natural"" group. There is conflicting evidence on the question of whether the living gymnosperms form a clade.[3][4] The fossil record of gymnosperms includes many distinctive taxa that do not belong to the four modern groups, including seed-bearing trees that have a somewhat fern-like vegetative morphology (the so-called ""seed ferns"" or pteridosperms', 'Seedless fruits can develop in one of two ways: either the fruit develops without fertilization (parthenocarpy), or pollination triggers fruit development, but the ovules or embryos abort without producing mature seeds (stenospermocarpy). Seedless banana and watermelon fruits are produced on triploid plants, whose three sets of chromosomes make it very unlikely for meiosis to produce fertile gametes', 'It is widely accepted that the gymnosperms originated in the late Carboniferous period, replacing the lycopsid rainforests of the tropical region.[8] [9] This appears to have been the result of a whole genome duplication event around 319\xa0million years ago.[10] Early characteristics of seed plants were evident in fossil progymnosperms of the late Devonian period around 383 million years ago']",either on the surface of scales or leaves
18,factories that assemble parts made in other countries,"Factories that assemble parts made in other countries are referred to as ""last industries"" or ""enclave import industries."" These industries add final touches to unfinished imported products. Examples include metal fabricating industries, pharmaceutical laboratories, and assembly and mixing plants. (Source: Context provided)","['In underdeveloped countries, industrialization takes place through such industries, through plants that add final touches to unfinished imported products. Examples are metal fabricating industries, pharmaceutical laboratories and assembly and mixing plants. Such industries have many advantages, as they often require the smaller amounts of capital available in such economies and without having to rely on unreliable domestic producers. Therefore, underdeveloped countries set up such ""last industries"" first. These industries create long chains of backward linkages', 'Disadvantages[edit]\nDisadvantages of the last industry strategy include inhibition of domestic production as domestic demand grows. This is because industrialists who work with imported material will often be hostile to the establishment of domestic industries, because domestic goods are of lower quality, the number of domestic suppliers is small, downstream competition may intensify once inputs are available domestically and competitors may be able to locate closer to the upstream suppliers.', 'Complementarity[edit]\nComplementarity is a situation where increased production of one good or service builds up demand for the second good or service. When the second product is privately produced, this demand will lead to imports or higher domestic production of the second product, as it will be in the interests of the producers to do so. Otherwise, the increased demand takes the form of political pressure. This is the case for such public services such as law and order, education, water and electricity that cannot reasonably be imported.\nInduced investment[edit]', 'External economies[edit]\nNew projects often appropriate external economies[clarification needed] created by preceding ventures and create external economies that may be utilized by subsequent ones. Sometimes the project undertaken creates external economies, causing private profit to fall short of what is socially desirable. The reverse is also possible. Some ventures have a larger input of external economies than the output. Therefore, Hirschman says, ""the projects that fall into this category must be net beneficiaries of external economies"".[citation needed]\nSocial Overhead Capital[edit]', 'Induced investment[edit]\nComplementarity allows investment in one industry or sector to encourage investment in others. This concept of induced investment is like a multiplier, because each investment triggers a series of subsequent events. Convergence occurs as the output of external economies diminishes at each step. Growth sequences tend to move towards convergence or divergence and the policy is usually concerned with preventing rapid convergence and promoting the possibility of divergence.[clarification needed]\nExternal economies[edit]', '. Market failure (such as imperfect competition or externalities) and some institutions of social decision-making (such as government and tradition) may lead to the wrong combination of goods being produced (hence the wrong mix of resources being allocated between producing the two goods) compared to what consumers would prefer, given what is feasible on the PPF.[19]', '. Factories hired everyone they could find regardless of their lack of skills—they simplified work tasks and trained the workers, with the federal government paying all the costs. Millions of farmers left marginal operations, students quit school and housewives joined the labor force.[101]', '. In the long term, the shift to efficiency wages led to high productivity, high wages and a high standard of living, but it necessitated a well-educated, well-trained, hard-working labor force. It was not before war time brought full employment that the supply of unskilled labor (that caused structural unemployment) downsized.[176]', 'Linkages and last industries[edit]\nThe development of an economy using the unbalanced method depends on the linkages between sectors. Hirschman suggests that the best strategy is induced industrialization. This type of development will create more backward and forward linkages and should be the first step taken.\nIndustries that transform semi-manufactured goods into goods needed by final demand are called ""last industries"" or ""enclave import industries"".', 'An outward shift of the PPF results from growth of the availability of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good']",special economic zones

30,how often does a speed limit sign need to be posted,No answer,"['Most public roads in most countries have a legally assigned numerical maximum speed limit which applies on all roads unless otherwise stated; lower speed limits are often shown on a sign at the start of the restricted section, although the presence of streetlights or the physical arrangement of the road may sometimes also be used instead. A posted speed limit may only apply to that road or to all roads beyond the sign that defines them depending on local laws', 'Signs are normally placed on both sides of the road and in some places there are small (less than 1/4 the size of the sign) rectangular orange reflector flags attached to both upper right corners of both signs. The speed limit sign marking the new speed zone may also have the orange flags; this practice can be observed in New York on highways where the speed limit varies such as New York State Route 17.\nSpeed limits on European Motorways in km/h', '. In the European Union, large signposts showing the national (default) speed limits of the respective country are usually erected immediately after border crossings, with a repeater sign some 200 to 500\xa0m (660 to 1,640\xa0ft) after the first sign. Some places provide an additional ""speed zone ahead"" ahead of the restriction and speed limit reminder signs may appear at regular intervals which may be painted on the road surface.', 'Road speed limits are used in most countries to set the maximum (or minimum in some cases) speed at which road vehicles may legally travel on particular stretches of road. Speed limits may be variable and in some places speed is unlimited (e.g. on some Autobahn sections in Germany). Speed limits are normally indicated on a traffic sign. Speed limits are commonly set by the legislative bodies of nations or provincial governments and enforced by national or regional police or judicial bodies.', 'In the late 1960s, heavily traveled portions of the New Jersey Turnpike began using variable speed limit signs, in combination with variable message signs. Officials can adjust the speed limit according to weather, traffic conditions, and construction.[62] More typically, variable speed limits are used on remote stretches of highway in the United States in areas with extreme changes in driving conditions', '.)[n 1] Speed limits may also be set in an attempt to reduce the environmental impact of road traffic (vehicle noise, vibration, emissions) and to satisfy local community wishes for streets usable by people out of cars. Some cities have reduced limits to as little as 30\xa0km/h (19\xa0mph) for both safety and efficiency reasons.[10] However, it has also been shown that in some circumstances changing a speed limit has little effect on the average speed of cars.[11]', 'In the United States, the signs are usually rectangular with the words ""SPEED LIMIT"" and the values in black on a white background. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration\'s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides guidelines for the appearance of speed limit signs. In Alaska and California, speed limits are often labeled ""MAXIMUM SPEED"" instead. In Oregon, most speed limit signs just say ""SPEED"" and the number. Canada has similar signs bearing the legend ""MAXIMUM"" and in km/h instead of mph', 'In some countries, derestriction signs are used to mark where a speed zone ends. The speed limit beyond the sign is the prevailing limit for the general area, for example the sign might be used to show the end of an urban area. In the United Kingdom, the sign means that the national speed limit applies (60\xa0mph on open roads, 70\xa0mph on dual carriageways and motorways)', 'In most of the world speed limit signs display the limitation within a red circle. This design follows the style set out by the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, with the exception of United States and Canada.[citation needed] All countries globally worldwide (except the United Kingdom and United States) use metric speed limits in kilometres per hour.[citation needed] Metric signs are optional in the United States though less commonly seen, while Samoa uses both units', 'Effectiveness[edit]\nTo be effective and applied by drivers, the speed limits need to be perceived as credible.[16] This mean that the speed limit should be adequate in regard to some factors such as, for instance, the view ahead and the view to the right.[16]\nTo be effective, speed limit needs to be set up with road infrastructure, education or enforcement activity.[16]\nA 1998 US Federal Highway administration report cited a number of studies regarding the effects of reductions in speed limits and the observed changes in speeding, fatalities, injuries and property damage which followed:[n 2]']",No answer
31,when are centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants used,"Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in various neurological conditions. They are commonly prescribed for low back pain, neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents in acute low back pain or fibromyalgia. Some specific examples include methocarbamol, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, metaxalone, and orphenadrine.","['A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone. It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, and hyperreflexia. The term ""muscle relaxant"" is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics. Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system (CNS) activity. They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis', 'Other skeletal muscle relaxants of that type used around the world come from a number of drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen, [8] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax skeletal muscles include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination', '. Spasmolytics, also known as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions. While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants,[1][2] the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only.[3][4]', 'In general, muscle relaxants are not approved by FDA for long-term use. However, rheumatologists often prescribe cyclobenzaprine nightly on a daily basis to increase stage 4 sleep. By increasing this sleep stage, patients feel more refreshed in the morning. Improving sleep is also beneficial for patients who have fibromyalgia.[20]\nMuscle relaxants such as tizanidine are prescribed in the treatment of tension headaches.[21]', ""Other common spasmolytic agents include: methocarbamol, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, metaxalone, and orphenadrine.\nSide effects[edit]\nMuscle relaxants are very powerful drugs which may produce negative effects, including heart failure and paralysis.[31] Patients most commonly report sedation as the main adverse effect of muscle relaxants. Usually, people become less alert when they are under the effects of muscle relaxant drugs. People are normally advised not to drive vehicles or operate heavy machinery while under muscle relaxants' effects."", 'Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and methocarbamol are commonly prescribed for low back pain or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome.[15] However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),[16][17] and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants.[15] Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs', 'The benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, interact with the GABAA receptor in the central nervous system. While it can be used in patients with muscle spasm of almost any origin, it produces sedation in most individuals at the doses required to reduce muscle tone.[5]', 'Muscle relaxants (according to one study) were not advised for orthopedic conditions, but rather for neurological conditions such as spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.[15] Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.\nMuscle relaxants are thought to be useful in painful disorders based on the theory that pain induces spasm and spasm causes pain. However, considerable evidence contradicts this theory.[18]', 'Clonidine and other imidazoline compounds have also been shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog, and is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine.[27] Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing spasticity', 'Terminology[edit]\nBecause they may act at the level of the cortex, brain stem or spinal cord, or all three areas, they have traditionally been referred to as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants. However, it is now known not every agent in this class has CNS activity (e.g. dantrolene), so this name is inaccurate.[5]']",to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions

His office would be considered to have been vacated if he is appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court or is transferred to some other High Court.

Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed after impeachment (though no justice has ever been removed).[3] In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation', 'The U.S. Constitution states that the President ""shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Judges of the Supreme Court.""[74] Most presidents nominate candidates who broadly share their ideological views, although a justice\'s decisions may end up being contrary to a president\'s expectations. Because the Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, a president may nominate anyone to serve, subject to Senate confirmation.', 'Qualifications of High Court Judges[edit]\nEach High Court could consist of a chief justice and up to 15 judges. Under §3 of the Act, judges could be selected from barristers (with 5 years of experience), civil servants (with 10 years of experience including 3 years as a zillah judge), judges of small cause courts or sudder ameen (with 5 years of experience), or pleaders of lander courts or High Courts (with 05 years of experience).', 'Salary:\nThe pay of the Chief Justice of a High Court is rupees 90,000/- per month and that of the other judges is rupees 85,000/- per month.\nPowers and Functions\nOriginal Jurisdiction:\nThe original jurisdiction of the High Court is restricted.\n(a) Every High Court under Article 226 is empowered to issue writs, orders, directions including writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo-warranto and Certiorari or any of them to any person or authority with in its territory for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and for any other purpose.', 'In addition, the other two branches can restrain the Court through other mechanisms. Congress can increase the number of justices, giving the President power to influence future decisions by appointments (as in Roosevelt\'s Court Packing Plan discussed above). Congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases: this is suggested by language in Section 2 of Article Three, where the appellate jurisdiction is granted ""with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make', 'Judicial Tenure and Seniority[edit]\nUnder §5 of the Act, judges served at the pleasure of Her Majesty. The chief justice had precedence over judges, whereas judges had seniority based on appointment. Under §14, the chief justice had the power to form divisions of two or more judges to hear cases.\nJurisdiction[edit]\nUnder article 9 of the Act, each High Court had ""all such powers and authority for and in relation to the administration of justice"" including original and appellate jurisdiction over civil, criminal, admiralty, vice-admiralty, testamentary, intestate, and matrimonial matters.', ""The Courts Act provides the current framework for appointment of the justices, which is done by the Lord Chancellor in the name of sovereign. Justices can also be removed by the same mechanism.

The catch of pearl oysters is similar to the numbers of oysters taken during the natural pearl days. Hence significant numbers of natural pearls are still found in the Australian Indian Ocean waters from wild oysters"", ""The gems and jewellery industry has been economically active in India for several thousand years.[177] Until the 18th century, India was the only major reliable source of diamonds.[173] Now, South Africa and Australia are the major sources of diamonds and precious metals, but along with Antwerp, New York, and Ramat Gan, Indian cities such as Surat and Mumbai are the hubs of world's jewellery polishing, cutting, precision finishing, supply and trade"", 'The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild, but are extremely rare. These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls. Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold.

While white, and more recently black, saltwater pearls are by far the most popular, other color tints can be found on pearls from the oceans. Pink, blue, champagne, green, black and even purple saltwater pearls can be encountered, but to collect enough of these rare colors to form a complete string of the same size and same shade can take years.\nReligious references[edit]', ""The particular strength of this sub-sector is in precision cutting, polishing and processing small diamonds (below one carat).[173] India is also a hub for processing of larger diamonds, pearls and other precious stones.

48,what was the purpose of a revival meeting during the second great awakening,"The purpose of revival meetings during the Second Great Awakening was to enroll millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations, stimulate the establishment of new denominations, and encourage individuals to experience personal salvation through direct contact with God. These meetings were emotionally powerful, focusing on individual sins and the necessity of turning to Christ for salvation. They also fostered the creation of small local churches and promoted social activism and reform movements aimed at addressing societal evils. (Source: [1])","['The revivals enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[1]', "". The revivals followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis of the individual's sins and need to turn to Christ, restored by a sense of personal salvation. Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.[14] The Second Great Awakening marked a religious transition in society in America. Many Americans from the Calvinist sect emphasized man's inability to save themselves and that their only way to be saved was from grace from God.[15]"", ""In the newly settled frontier regions, the revival was implemented through camp meetings. These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion, and they were important as social venues. The camp meeting was a religious service of several days' length with preachers. Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship. The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events"", ""There were also societies that broadened their focus from traditional religious concerns to larger societal ones. These organizations were primarily sponsored by affluent women. They did not stem entirely from the Second Great Awakening, but the revivalist doctrine and the expectation that one's conversion would lead to personal action accelerated the role of women's social benevolence work.[26] Social activism influenced abolition groups and supporters of the Temperance movement. They began efforts to reform prisons and care for the handicapped and mentally ill"", 'The religious enthusiasm of the Second Great Awakening was echoed by the new political enthusiasm of the Second Party System.[40] More active participation in politics by more segments of the population brought religious and moral issues into the political sphere. The spirit of evangelical humanitarian reforms was carried on in the antebellum Whig party.[41]', 'See also: Restorationism\nThe idea of restoring a ""primitive"" form of Christianity grew in popularity in the U.S. after the American Revolution.[21]:89–94 This desire to restore a purer form of Christianity without an elaborate hierarchy contributed to the development of many groups during the Second Great Awakening, including the Mormons, Baptists and Shakers.[21]:89 Several factors made the restoration sentiment particularly appealing during this time period:[21]:90–94', 'Congregationalists set up missionary societies to evangelize the western territory of the northern tier. Members of these groups acted as apostles for the faith, and also as educators and exponents of northeastern urban culture. The Second Great Awakening served as an ""organizing process"" that created ""a religious and educational infrastructure"" across the western frontier that encompassed social networks, a religious journalism that provided mass communication, and church-related colleges', 'The Second Great Awakening occurred in several episodes and over different denominations; however, the revivals were very similar.[4] As the most effective form of evangelizing during this period, revival meetings cut across geographical boundaries,[7] and the movement quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers, known as circuit riders, who sought out people in remote frontier locations', 'Calvinism portal\nv\nt\ne\nBackground[edit]\nLike the First Great Awakening a half century earlier, the Second reflected Romanticism characterized by enthusiasm, emotion, and an appeal to the super-natural.[3] It rejected the skepticism, deism, and rationalism left over from the Enlightenment.[4] At about the same time, similar movements flourished in Europe. Pietism was sweeping German countries.[5] Evangelicalism was waxing strong in England.[6]', 'Historians named the Second Great Awakening in the context of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s and of the Third Great Awakening of the late 1850s to early 1900s.

The neural retina refers to the three layers of neural cells (photo receptor cells, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells) within the retina, which in its entirety comprises ten distinct layers, including an outer layer of pigmented epithelial cells.

54,who said if a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it,"George Berkeley said, ""But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park [...] and nobody by to perceive them."" This is part of his philosophy that objects exist only when they are perceived.","['The current phrasing appears to have originated in the 1910 book Physics by Charles Riborg Mann and George Ransom Twiss. The question ""When a tree falls in a lonely forest, and no animal is near by to hear it, does it make a sound? Why?"" is posed along with many other questions to quiz readers on the contents of the chapter, and as such, is posed from a purely physical point of view.[6]\nMetaphysics[edit]\nThe possibility of unperceived existence[edit]\nMain article: George Berkeley', '.[7] George Berkeley in the 18th century developed subjective idealism, a metaphysical theory to respond to these questions, coined famously as ""to be is to be perceived"". Today meta-physicists are split. According to substance theory, a substance is distinct from its properties, while according to bundle theory, an object is merely its sense data. The definition of sound, simplified, is a hearable noise. The tree will make a sound, even if nobody heard it. The definition states that sound is a hearable noise. So the tree could have been heard, though nobody was around to do so.', 'Philosopher George Berkeley, in his work, A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710), proposes, ""But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park [...] and nobody by to perceive them.[1] [...] The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden [...] no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them.""[2] (It is worth noting that the quote from section 45 is arguably a statement of an objection to Berkeley\'s view, and not a proclamation of it', 'Can something exist without being perceived? – e.g. ""is sound only sound if a person hears it?"" The most immediate philosophical topic that the riddle introduces involves the existence of the tree (and the sound it produces) outside of human perception. If no one is around to see, hear, touch or smell the tree, how could it be said to exist? What is it to say that it exists when such an existence is unknown? Of course, from a scientific viewpoint, it exists.[7] It is human beings that are able to perceive it', 'If a tree falls in a forest - Wikipedia\n \nIf a tree falls in a forest \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nFor the 2011 documentary, see If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front.\nA fallen tree in a forest\n""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" is a philosophical thought experiment that raises questions regarding observation and perception.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 History\n2 Metaphysics\n2.1 The possibility of unperceived existence\n2.2 Knowledge of the unobserved world', 'Some years later, a similar question is posed. It is unknown whether the source of this question is Berkeley or not. In June 1883 in the magazine The Chautauquan, the question was put, ""If a tree were to fall on an island where there were no human beings would there be any sound?"" They then went on to answer the query with, ""No. Sound is the sensation excited in the ear when the air or other medium is set in motion.""[4] This seems to imply that the question is posed not from a philosophical viewpoint, but from a purely scientific one', ""Perhaps the most important topic the riddle offers is the division between perception of an object and how an object really is. If a tree exists outside of perception then there is no way for us to know that the tree exists. So then, what do we mean by 'existence', what is the difference between perception and reality? Also, people may also say, if the tree exists outside of perception (as common sense would dictate), then it will produce sound waves. However, these sound waves will not actually sound like anything"", 'A similar question does not involve whether or not an unobserved event occurs predictably, like it occurs when it is observed. The anthropic principle suggests that the observer, just in its existence, may impose on the reality observed. However, most people, as well as scientists, assume that the observer doesn\'t change whether the tree-fall causes a sound or not, but this is an impossible claim to prove. However, many scientists would argue as follows, ""A truly unobserved event is one which realises no effect (imparts no information) on any other (where \'other\' might be e.g', '""The shrutis (a subdivision of the Vedas) and the sages say that the objects are only mental creations.

The Tin Woodman little by little lost his natural body and had it replaced by metal; so he has lost his heart and cannot move without the help of farmers (represented by the Scarecrow); in reality he has a strong sense of cooperation and love, which needs only an infusion of self-confidence to be awakened. In the 1890s many argued that to secure a political revolution a coalition of Farmers and Workers was needed.[16]', 'The Wizard turns out to be a ""humbug"" and can only provide a placebo heart made of silk and filled with sawdust. However, this is enough to please the Tin Woodman, who, with or without a heart, was all along the most tender and emotional of Dorothy\'s companions (just as the Scarecrow was the wisest and the Cowardly Lion the bravest).

Low range gears are engaged with a shifter or electronic switch. On many transfer cases, this shifter is the same as the one that selects 2WD or 4WD operation. Low range gears allow the vehicle to drive at much slower speeds while still operating within the usable power band / RPM range of the engine. This also increases the torque available at the axles. Low-range gears are used during slow-speed or extreme off-road maneuvers, such as rockcrawling, navigating dangerous roads, or when pulling a heavy load', 'Manual Shift On-the-Fly transfer cases have a selector lever on the driver\'s side floor transmission hump and may also have either two sealed automatic front axle locking hubs or two manual front axle hub selectors of ""LOCK"" and ""UNLOCK"" or ""FREE"".

Notable production centers include the Yakima Valley in Washington, Willamette Valley in Oregon, and Western Canyon County in Idaho.","[""Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates, with much of the world's production occurring near the 48th parallel north. Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato-growing states in the United States are also major hops-producing areas;[16] however, not all potato-growing areas can produce good hops naturally: soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, for example, lack the boron that hops prefer.[16] Historically, hops were not grown in Ireland, but were imported from England"", 'Although hops are grown in most of the continental United States and Canada,[23] cultivation of hops for commercial production requires a particular environment. As hops are a climbing plant, they are trained to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same sunlight profile. In this way, energy that would have been required to build structural cells is also freed for crop growth.[24][citation needed]', 'Wine regions[edit]\nThe Pacific Northwest includes in the winemaking regions of Washington State where varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon are grown.\nThere are nearly 3,000 commercial vineyards in the United States, and at least one winery in each of the 50 states.[14]\nWest Coast – More than 90% of the total American wine production occurs in the states of California, Washington and Oregon.\nRocky Mountain Region – Notably Idaho and Colorado\nSouthwestern United States – Notably Texas and New Mexico\nMidwestern United States – Notably Missouri and Illinois', ""Hop cultivation was begun in the present-day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers.[13] Before prohibition, cultivation was mainly centred around New York, California, Oregon, and Washington state.

Each spring, the roots send forth new bines that are started up strings from the ground to an overhead trellis. The cones grow high on the bine, and in the past, these cones were picked by hand.

It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats.', 'Gallbladder[edit]\nThe gallbladder is a hollow part of the biliary tract that sits just beneath the liver, with the gallbladder body resting in a small depression.[23] It is a small organ where the bile produced by the liver is stored, before being released into the small intestine. Bile flows from the liver through the bile ducts and into the gall bladder for storage. The bile is released in response to cholecystokinin (CCK) a peptide hormone released from the duodenum. The production of CCK (by endocrine cells of the duodenum) is stimulated by the presence of fat in the duodenum.[24]', 'The main purpose of the gallbladder is to store bile, also called gall, needed for the digestion of fats in food. Produced by the liver, bile flows through small vessels into the larger hepatic ducts and ultimately though the cystic duct (parts of the biliary tree) into the gallbladder, where it is stored. At any one time, 30 to 60 millilitres (1.0 to 2.0\xa0US\xa0fl\xa0oz) of bile is stored within the gallbladder.[15]', '. The main purpose of the gallbladder is to store and release bile, or gall.

80,what is the first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis,"The first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis is the absorption of light energy by proteins containing chlorophyll pigments. These proteins are located in chloroplasts in plants or in the plasma membrane in bacteria. This absorption of light energy initiates a series of reactions known as the light-dependent reactions, which produce energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. [Source: Context provided]","['CO2 + (AsO3−\n3) + photons → (AsO3−\n4) + CO[16]\ncarbon dioxide + arsenite + light energy → arsenate + carbon monoxide (used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.', 'Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas', ""In the light-dependent reactions(mainly three vital reaction steps\xa0: (I) Hill and Bendall's Z-scheme of cyclic and non-cyclic reactions, (II) Mitchell's chemi-osmosis for ATP synthesis and (III) Dolai's S-state diagrams in water -splitting), one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a quinone molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH"", 'In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin', '. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions; the electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active tyrosine residue that then reduces the oxidized chlorophyll a (called P680) that serves as the primary light-driven electron donor in the photosystem II reaction center. That photo receptor is in effect reset and is then able to repeat the absorption of another photon and the release of another photo-dissociated electron', 'Contents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Overview\n2 Photosynthetic membranes and organelles\n3 Light-dependent reactions\n3.1 Z scheme\n3.2 Water photolysis\n4 Light-independent reactions\n4.1 Calvin cycle\n4.2 Carbon concentrating mechanisms\n4.2.1 On land\n4.2.2 In water\n5 Order and kinetics\n6 Efficiency\n7 Evolution\n7.1 Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts\n7.2 Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis\n8 Discovery\n8.1 Development of the concept\n8.2 C3\xa0: C4 photosynthesis research\n9 Factors\n9.1 Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature\n9.2 Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration\n10 See also', 'The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic, but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name cyclic reaction.\nWater photolysis\nMain articles: Photodissociation and Oxygen evolution', '. However, since photosystem II is the first step of the Z-scheme, an external source of electrons is required to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a molecules. The source of electrons in green-plant and cyanobacterial photosynthesis is water', 'Factors\nThe leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants.\nThere are three main factors affecting photosynthesis and several corollary factors.

The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending on specific pigment-protein interactions.', 'Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms\' activities (energy transformation). This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek φῶς, phōs, ""light"", and σύνθεσις, synthesis, ""putting together"".[1][2][3] In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product']",one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron

85,which mode is used for short wave broadcast service,"Shortwave broadcast service typically uses skywave or ""skip"" propagation, taking advantage of reflections from the ionosphere to achieve long-distance communication.","['Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave radio frequencies. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), and generally extends from 1.7–30\xa0MHz (176.3–10.0\xa0m); from the high end of the medium frequency band (MF) just above the mediumwave AM broadcast band, to the end of the HF band.', 'Many newer shortwave receivers are portable and can be battery-operated, making them useful in difficult circumstances. Newer technology includes hand-cranked radios which provide power without batteries.\nShortwave radios can be used in situations where Internet or satellite communications service is temporarily or long-term unavailable (or unaffordable).\nShortwave radio travels much farther than broadcast FM (88–108\xa0MHz). Shortwave broadcasts can be easily transmitted over a distance of several thousands of kilometers, including from one continent to another.', 'Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon. This is called skywave or ""skip"" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about 40 miles (64\xa0km)', '. Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. It is also used for military over-the-horizon radar, diplomatic communication, and two-way international communication by amateur radio enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes, as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications.', 'The new digital audio broadcasting format for shortwave DRM operates 10\xa0kHz or 20\xa0kHz channels. There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM, as it mainly transmitted in 10\xa0kHz format.\nThe power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and over-the-horizon radar. Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized antenna designs (like the ALLISS antenna technology) to concentrate radio energy at the target area.', 'Amateur radio operators also discovered that long-distance communication was possible on shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used surface wave propagation at very low frequencies,[13] which are attenuated along the path at wavelengths shorter than 1,000\xa0meters. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal loss. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.', 'The name ""shortwave"" originated during the early days of radio in the early 20th century, when the radio spectrum was considered divided into long wave (LW), medium wave (MW) and short wave bands based on the wavelength of the radio waves. Shortwave radio received its name because the wavelengths in this band are relatively shorter than 200\xa0m (1,500\xa0kHz) which marked the original upper limit of the medium frequency band first used for radio communications.

It was also difficult to beam the radio wave directionally with long wave, resulting in a major loss of power over long distances.

87,where is most vascular tissue found in plants,"Most vascular tissue in plants is found in vascular bundles, which include both xylem and phloem. These bundles are located in stems, roots, and leaves. In stems and roots, xylem is typically closer to the interior while phloem is towards the exterior. In leaves, the xylem is oriented toward the adaxial surface and phloem toward the abaxial surface.","['The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes. The individual cells of phloem are connected end-to-end, just as the sections of a pipe might be. As the plant grows, new vascular tissue differentiates in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant', 'Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue, formed of more than one cell type, found in vascular plants. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant.', '. The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles. These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells. In stems and roots, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem. In the stems of some Asterales dicots, there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well.', 'Between the xylem and phloem is a meristem called the vascular cambium. This tissue divides off cells that will become additional xylem and phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length. As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem', 'In leaves, the vascular bundles are located among the spongy mesophyll. The xylem is oriented toward the adaxial surface of the leaf (usually the upper side), and phloem is oriented toward the abaxial surface of the leaf. This is why aphids are typically found on the underside of the leaves rather than on the top, since the phloem transports sugars manufactured by the plant and they are closer to the lower surface.[citation needed]\nSee also[edit]\nXylem\nPhloem\nCork cambium\nVascular cambium\nVascular plant\nStele (biology)\nCirculatory system\nExternal links[edit]', 'Circulatory system\nExternal links[edit]\nIntro to Plant Structure Contains diagrams of the plant tissues, listed as an outline.\n[show]\nv\nt\ne\nBiological tissues\nAnimals\nEpithelial\nConnective\nMuscular\nNervous\nPlants\nDermal tissue\nEpidermis: Cuticle\nPavement cell\nGuard cell\nSubsidiary cell\nPeriderm: Phellem\nPhelloderm\nVascular tissue\nPhloem: Sieve tube\nCompanion cell\nPhloem fiber\nPhloem parenchyma\nXylem: Tracheid\nVessel element\nXylem fiber\nXylem parenchyma\nGround tissue\nParenchyma: Chlorenchyma\nAerenchyma\nCollenchyma\nSclerenchyma: Sclereid\nFiber\nMeristematic tissue\nPrimary: Protoderm\nProcambium', 'Stem usually consist of three tissues, dermal tissue, ground tissue and vascular tissue.

Into the 1970s, the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with a significant problem, as people would frequently discard the pull-tabs on the ground as litter, or drop them into the can and risk choking on them. These problems were both addressed by the invention of the ""push-tab"". Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up', ""History[edit]\nSee also: Tin can §\xa0History\nThe first commercial beer available in cans began in 1935 in Richmond, Virginia.[2] Not long after that, sodas, with their higher acidity and somewhat higher pressures, were available in cans. The key development for storing beverages in cans was the interior liner, typically plastic or sometimes a waxy substance, that helped to keep the product's flavor from being ruined by a chemical reaction with the metal. Another major factor for the timing was the repeal of Prohibition in the United States at the end of 1933."", 'Beverage can - Wikipedia\n \nBeverage can\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\n""Beer can"" redirects here.

The \'wide-mouth\' version, seen here, was introduced in the late 1990s.', 'Press button cans were used by Pepsi in Canada from the 1970s to 1980s and Coors in the 1970s. They have since been replaced with pull tabs. Used in Australia, locally known as ""pop-tops"", for soft drinks during the early 1980s.\nFull Aperture End[edit]', "". It needed no ring to pull up. Instead, the raised aluminium blister was pushed down into the can, with a small unscored piece that kept the tab connected after being pushed inside. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person's finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening"", 'By the time the United States entered World War II, cans had gained only about ten percent of the beverage container market; this was drastically reduced during the war to accommodate strategic needs for metal.\nA pop tab from the 1970s', 'Cans are usually in sealed paperboard cartons, corrugated fiberboard boxes, or trays covered with plastic film. The entire distribution system and packaging need to be controlled to ensure freshness.[15]\nPop-tab[edit]\nOld style pull-tab in use on a can of Tsingtao beer in Beijing, China in 2009', 'The early pull-tabs detached easily. In 1976 the Journal of the American Medical Association noted cases of children ingesting pull-tabs that had broken off and dropped into the can.[18]\nFull-top pull-tabs were also used in some oil cans and are currently used in some soup, pet food, tennis ball, nuts and other cans.\nStay-on-tab[edit]\nA ""standard"" size can opening, once common in American soft drinks.', '. An unusual feature of the push-tab Coors Beer cans was that they had a second, smaller, push-tab at the top as an airflow vent\xa0— a convenience that was lost with the switch from can opener to pull-tab. The ""push-tab"" was introduced into Australia in the early 1980s and was locally known as ""pop-tops"".']",1970s

Other commonly served dishes include winter squash and sweet potatoes, the latter often prepared with sweeteners such as brown sugar, molasses, or marshmallows', 'The centerpiece of contemporary Thanksgiving in the United States and Canada is a large meal, generally centered on a large roasted turkey. It is served with a variety of side dishes which vary from traditional dishes such as mashed potatoes, stuffing, and cranberry sauce,[1] to ones that reflect regional or cultural heritage.[2] The majority of the dishes in the traditional American version of Thanksgiving dinner are made from foods native to the New World, as according to tradition the Pilgrims received these foods, or learned how to grow them, from the Native Americans', '. Fresh, canned, or frozen corn is popular and green beans are frequently served; in particular, green bean casserole, a product invented in 1955 by the Campbell Soup Company to promote use of its cream of mushroom soup, has become a Thanksgiving standard. A fresh salad may be included, especially on the West Coast. Bread rolls or biscuits and cornbread, especially in the South and parts of New England, are served. For dessert, various pies are usually served, particularly pumpkin pie, though apple pie, mincemeat pie, sweet potato pie, and pecan pie are often served as well.', 'Most Thanksgiving turkeys are stuffed with a bread-based mixture and roasted. Sage is the traditional herb added to the stuffing, along with chopped celery, carrots, and onions. Other ingredients, such as chopped chestnuts or other tree nuts, crumbled sausage or bacon, cranberries, raisins, or apples, may be added to stuffing. If this mixture is prepared outside the bird, it may be known as dressing. Deep-fried turkey is rising in popularity due to its shorter preparation time, but carries safety risks.', 'In the United States, a globalist approach to Thanksgiving has become common with the impact of immigration.

Like many children of the time he was familiar with the Alice books and had read them as a school boy.[7]"", ""In 1938, after the enormous success of Snow White, Disney revived the idea of making an Alice feature and officially registered the title Alice in Wonderland with the Motion Picture Association of America and hired storyboard artist Al Perkins and art director David S. Hall to develop the story and concept art for the film.[7] A storyreel was complete in 1939, but Walt was not pleased as he felt that Hall's drawings resembled Tenniel's drawings too closely making them too difficult to animate and that the overall tone of Perkins' script was too grotesque and dark"", ""In 1945, shortly after the war ended, Disney once again revived Alice in Wonderland and assigned British author Aldous Huxley to re-write the script. However, Walt felt that Huxley's version was too much of a literal adaptation of Carroll's book.[9] Background artist Mary Blair submitted some concept drawings for Alice in Wonderland. Blair's paintings moved away from Tenniel's sketchy illustrations by taking a modernist stance, using bold and unreal colors.

Gordon, after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:\nHe was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.[11]"", 'The lyrics tell the story of a man who looks up and whistles while he is walking so that his tears will not fall. The verses of the song describe his memories and feelings. Rokusuke Ei wrote this song while coming back from a protest against the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and feeling dejected about the failure of the protest movement, but the lyrics were rendered purposefully generic so that they might refer to any lost love', "".[31] Some scholars interpret the yearly cycles, each beginning and ending in winter, as the poet's attempt to convey the inevitable fall of all things good and noble in the world. Such a theme is strengthened by the image of Troy, a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which, according to the Aeneid, fell to the Greeks due to pride and ignorance.

122,why did the attack on pearl harbor take place,"The attack on Pearl Harbor took place because Japan aimed to destroy the U.S. Pacific Fleet to prevent interference with their planned conquests in Southeast Asia and to gain time to consolidate their position before U.S. shipbuilding capabilities became a threat. Additionally, Japan sought to deliver a blow to American morale and force the U.S. to accept a compromise peace. Sources: [15], [50][51], [52][53].","['Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions that were planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.[15]', 'The Japanese attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson-Walsh Act erased any chance of victory', "".[50][51] Third, to deliver a blow to America's ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time.[50] Finally, it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests, and would seek a compromise peace with Japan.[52][53]"", 'Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.[163] To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset', ""Kuril Islands\nShumshu\nSecond Sino-Japanese War\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor,[11] led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI,[12][13] and as Operation Z during its planning.[14]"", ""Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages: the targeted ships would be in very shallow water, so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them; and most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor. A further important disadvantage—this of timing, and known to the Japanese—was the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers (Enterprise, Lexington, and Saratoga)"", '.[164] On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific.[165] These included an attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, landings in Thailand and Malaya[165] and the battle of Hong Kong.', 'Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the ""Southern Resource Area"" (the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan\'s Combined Fleet.[40] He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command', 'By late 1941, many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent. A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not, and 21% had no opinion.[47] While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions, U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target; instead, they expected the Philippines would be attacked first', 'On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, bringing it too into the war on the Allied side.

Because of this, species abundance in coral reef fish communities was estimated to be greatest at approximately 20% coral cover.

133,who did shakespeare write his play hamlet for,"Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage, the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain's Men.","[""Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range.[136][137][p] Judging by the number of reprints, Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only Henry IV Part 1, Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it.[2] Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.[141]"", 'Hamlet is Shakespeare\'s longest play, and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature, with a story capable of ""seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others"".[1] It was probably one of Shakespeare\'s most popular works during his lifetime,[2] and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879', 'Hamlet departed from contemporary dramatic convention in several ways. For example, in Shakespeare\'s day, plays were usually expected to follow the advice of Aristotle in his Poetics: that a drama should focus on action, not character. In Hamlet, Shakespeare reverses this so that it is through the soliloquies, not the action, that the audience learns Hamlet\'s motives and thoughts. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action, except in the ""bad"" quarto', ""The story of Shakespeare's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have. He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time"", '. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play\'s sense of duality and dislocation.[94] Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in Hamlet because he ""showed how a character\'s language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings""', ""Hamlet's soliloquies have also captured the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.[95]\nContext and interpretation[edit]\nReligious[edit]"", "". At one point, as in the Gravedigger scene,[a] Hamlet seems resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, however, when Claudius appears, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these twists are mistakes or intentional additions to add to the play's themes of confusion and duality.[79] Hamlet also contains a recurrent Shakespearean device, a play within the play, a literary device or conceit in which one story is told during the action of another story.[g]"", '.[38] Katherine Duncan-Jones accepts a 1600–1 attribution for the date Hamlet was written, but notes that the Lord Chamberlain\'s Men, playing Hamlet in the 3000-capacity Globe, were unlikely to be put to any disadvantage by an audience of ""barely one hundred"" for the Children of the Chapel\'s equivalent play, Antonio\'s Revenge; she believes that Shakespeare, confident in the superiority of his own work, was making a playful and charitable allusion to his friend John Marston\'s very similar piece.[44]', ""Influence[edit]\nSee also: Literary influence of Hamlet\nHamlet is one of the most quoted works in the English language, and is often included on lists of the world's greatest literature.[o] As such, it reverberates through the writing of later centuries. Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of Hamlet in numerous modern narratives, and divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play's composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play.[126]"", ""Hamlet is often played with contemporary political overtones. Leopold Jessner's 1926 production at the Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius's court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of Kaiser Wilhelm.[183] In Poland, the number of productions of Hamlet has tended to increase at times of political unrest, since its political themes (suspected crimes, coups, surveillance) can be used to comment on a contemporary situation""]","almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage"

After primary training at Moton Field, they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field, about 10 miles (16\xa0km) to the west for conversion training onto operational types. Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location', '. The Air Corps determined that the existing programs would be used for all units, including all-black units. At Tuskegee, this effort continued with the selection and training of the Tuskegee Airmen. The War Department set up a system to accept only those with a level of flight experience or higher education which ensured that only the most able and intelligent African-American applicants were able to join.[citation needed]', 'Tuskegee Airmen were instrumental in postwar developments in aviation.

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans,[1] as well as among church leaders and among women in general', '. Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican–American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British Intelligence. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for ""a war to end all wars"" that would ""make the world safe for democracy"", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.[4]', ""NY Times main headline, April 2, 1917, President Calls for War Declaration, Stronger Navy, New Army of 500,000 Men, Full Cooperation With Germany's Foes\nPresident Wilson's War Address\nMap of Europe at the time of the US declaration of war on Germany at omniatlas.com\nWorld War I: Declarations of War from Around the Globe - How America Entered the Great War\nToday in History: U.S. Enters World War I\n[hide]\nv\nt\ne\nWoodrow Wilson\n28th President of the United States (1913–1921)\n34th Governor of New Jersey (1911–1913)\n13th President of Princeton University (1902–1910)\nPresidency\n1913 inauguration"", ""Once Germany had decided on unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, and knowing it would be attacking all American ships in the North Atlantic, it tried to line up new allies, especially Mexico.

Zimmerman invited Mexico (knowing their resentment towards America since the 1848 Mexican Cession) to join in a war against the United States. Germany promised to pay for Mexico's costs and to help it recover the territory annexed by the U.S. in 1848"", 'Sinking of American merchant ships[edit]\nIn early 1917 Berlin forced the issue.

He could be a version of the Green Man, a mythological being connected with nature in medieval art, a Christian symbol, or the Devil himself. British medieval scholar C. S. Lewis said the character was ""as vivid and concrete as any image in literature"" and J. R. R. Tolkien said he was the ""most difficult character"" to interpret in Sir Gawain. His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious', ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was adapted into an opera called Gawain by Harrison Birtwistle, first performed in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised for maintaining the complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form.[112] Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's Gwyneth and the Green Knight, first performed in 2002.

143,what caused the breakup of the democratic republican party,"The breakup of the Democratic-Republican Party was primarily caused by the events surrounding the 1824 presidential election. The election resulted in a deadlock, leading to a compromise where Henry Clay supported John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson. This decision alienated many supporters of Jackson, causing a split within the party. Some followers of Jackson formed the new Democratic Party by 1828, while another group led by Adams and Clay formed the National Republican Party, which later evolved into the Whig Party.

They called themselves ""Republicans"" after their ideology, republicanism. They distrusted the Federalist commitment to republicanism. The party splintered in 1824 into the Jacksonian movement (which became the Democratic Party in 1828) and the short-lived National Republican Party (later succeeded by the Whig Party).', ""The Democratic-Republican Party was an American political party formed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison between 1791 and 1793 to oppose the centralizing policies of the new Federalist Party run by Alexander Hamilton, who was secretary of the treasury and chief architect of George Washington's administration.[5] From 1801 to 1825, the new party controlled the presidency and Congress as well as most states during the First Party System. It began in 1791 as one faction in Congress and included many politicians who had been opposed to the new constitution"", ""The Adams/Clay alliance became the basis of the National Republican Party, a rival to the Jackson's Democracy and one of the successors of the Democratic-Republican Party. This party favored a higher tariff in order to protect U.S. manufacturers, as well as public works, especially roads. Many former members of the defunct Federalist Party, including Daniel Webster, joined the party. After Clay's defeat by Jackson in the 1832 presidential election, the National Republicans were absorbed into the Whig Party, a diverse group of Jackson opponents"", 'The Federalist Party of the United States was opposed by the Democratic-Republicans, including powerful figures such as Thomas Jefferson. The Democratic-Republicans mainly believed that: the Legislature had too much power (mainly because of the Necessary and Proper Clause) and that they were unchecked; the Executive had too much power, and that there was no check on the executive; a dictator would arise; and that a bill of rights should be coupled with the constitution to prevent a dictator (then believed to eventually be the president) from exploiting or tyrannizing citizens', 'The party coalesced around Jefferson, who diligently maintained extensive correspondence with like-minded Republican leaders throughout the country. Washington frequently decried the growing sense of ""party"" emerging from the internal battles among Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Adams and others in his administration. As warfare in Europe increased, the two factions increasingly made foreign policy the central political issue of the day. The Republicans wanted to maintain the 1778 alliance with France, which had overthrown the monarchy and aristocracy and become a republic', 'A split appeared in the then Republican party during the 1824 elections (at the end of the Monroe administration). When the election was thrown to the House of Representatives, Henry Clay backed John Quincy Adams to deny the presidency to Andrew Jackson, a longtime political rival. Jackson defeated Adams in 1828 and in the next election the first Democratic national convention took place in Baltimore, Maryland on May 21–23, 1832. It nominated Andrew Jackson for a second term and he went on to win the presidential election.', '. One remnant followed Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren into the new Democratic Party by 1828. Another remnant led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay formed the National Republicans in 1828, which developed into the Whig Party by 1835.[7]', '. Taking a leaf from the Jacksonians, the Whigs tended to nominate non-ideological war heroes as their presidential candidates. The Whig party fell apart in the 1850s over the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery into new territories.', 'The modern Republican Party was formed in 1854 to oppose the expansion of slavery. Many former Whig party leaders (such as Abraham Lincoln – modern Republican Party supporters still sometimes refer to themselves as ""the party of Lincoln"") and former Free Soil Party leaders joined the newly formed anti-slavery party.[34] The party sought to combine Jefferson\'s ideals of liberty and equality with Clay\'s program of using an active government to modernize the economy.[35]\nPresidents[edit]']",the disputed 1824 presidential election

An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength.

150,explain what will happen if a normal gamete like y fertilises gamete x,"If a normal gamete 'y' fertilizes gamete 'x', the following events occur:
1. Fusion of cell membranes between the sperm (gamete 'y') and the egg (gamete 'x') takes place.
2. The sperm nucleus fuses with the ovum, enabling the fusion of their genetic material.
3. The oocyte completes its second meiotic division, forming a mature ovum with a pronucleus.
4. The fused genetic material results in a zygote, which starts prenatal development.
5. The resulting zygote's sex is determined by the combination of the X and Y chromosomes carried by the sperm.
   - If the zygote has two X chromosomes, it develops into a female.
   - If the zygote has an X and a Y chromosome, it develops into a male.

The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body. The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum, enabling fusion of their genetic material.\nCell membranes[edit]\nThe fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place.\nTransformations[edit]', 'Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century.[1]', 'A gamete (from Ancient Greek γαμετή gamete from gamein ""to marry""[1]) is a haploid cell that fuses with another haploid cell during fertilization (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum (or egg)—and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type—called a sperm. In short a gamete is an egg (female gamete) or a sperm (male gamete)', 'The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum. The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation, follows with ovulation, and finishes with fertilization. Various exceptions to this sequence are possible, including artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, external ejaculation without copulation, or copulation shortly after ovulation.[2][3][4] Upon encountering the secondary oocyte, the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg', 'Transformations[edit]\nIn preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes.\nThe oocyte completes its second meiotic division. This results in a mature ovum. The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process, to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization.', 'Anatomy[edit]\nCorona radiata[edit]\nThe sperm binds through the corona radiata, a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte. Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell, known as zygote. The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism.\nCone of attraction and perivitelline membrane[edit]', 'In humans, a normal ovum can carry only an X chromosome (of the X and Y chromosomes), whereas a sperm may carry either an X or a Y (a non-normal ovum can end up carrying two or no X chromosomes, as a result of a irregularity at either of the two stages of meiosis, while a non-normal sperm cell can end up carrying either no sex-defining chromosomes, an XY pair, or XX pair as a result of the forementioned reason); ergo the male sperm can play a role in determining the sex of any resulting zygote, if the zygote has two X chromosomes it may develop into a female, if it has an X and a Y', 'Plants which reproduce sexually also have gametes. However, since plants have an alternation of diploid and haploid generations some differences exist. In flowering plants the flowers use meiosis to produce a haploid generation which produce gametes through mitosis. The female haploid is called the ovule and is produced by the ovary of the flower. When mature the haploid ovule produces the female gamete which are ready for fertilization. The male haploid is pollen and is produced by the anther, when pollen lands on a mature stigma of a flower it grows a pollen tube down into the flower', 'Oogenesis is the process of female gamete formation in animals. This process involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary oocyte to produce the haploid ovum (gamete). Spermatogenesis is the process of male gamete formation in animals. This process also involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary spermatocyte to produce the haploid spermatozoon (gamete).\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Dissimilarity\n2 Sex determination in humans and birds\n3 Artificial gametes\n4 Plants\n5 Notes and references\nDissimilarity[edit]', 'Each of the two daughter cells resulting from that mitosis has one replica of each chromatid that was replicated in the previous stage. Thus, they are genetically identical.\nFertilization age[edit]\nFertilization is the event most commonly used to mark the zero point in descriptions of prenatal development of the embryo or fetus. The resultant age is known as fertilization age, fertilizational age, embryonic age, fetal age or (intrauterine) developmental (IUD)[14] age.']",No answer

158,global trade during the ming dynasty of china,"Global trade during the Ming dynasty of China was significant and thriving. The Ming dynasty engaged in extensive trade with both Europe and Japan. Estimates suggest that approximately 300 million taels of silver flowed into the Ming dynasty, equivalent to over 190 billion dollars today. Additionally, the Ming imported European firearms to maintain modern weaponry. These developments contributed to the economic growth and prosperity of the era. 

Source: [5]","['The Ming saw the rise of commercial plantations who produced crops suitable to their regions. Tea, fruits, paint and other goods were produced on a massive scale by these agricultural plantations. Regional patterns of production established during this period continued into the Qing dynasty.[5] The Columbian exchange brought crops such as corn with these foreign crops. During the Ming, specialized areas also popped up planting large numbers of cash crops that could be sold at markets. Large numbers of peasants abandoned the land to become artisans', 'Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy, and was aided by the construction of canals, roads, and bridges by the Ming government. The Ming saw the rise of several merchant clans such as the Huai and Jin clans, who disposed of large amounts of wealth. The gentry and merchant classes started to fuse, and the merchants gained power at the expense of the state. Some merchants were reputed to have a treasure of 30 million taels.\nTaxation[edit]', ""The Ming Empire around 1580\nThe economy of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) of China was the largest in the world during that period. It is regarded as one of China's three golden ages (the other two being the Han and Song periods). The period was marked by the increasing political influence of the merchants, the gradual weakening of imperial rule, and technological advances.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Currency\n2 Manufactures\n2.1 Privatization\n2.2 Emergence of wage labor\n3 Early encouragement of agriculture under Hongwu\n3.1 Emergence of commercial plantations\n3.2 Rural markets during the Ming"", '. Despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the treasure voyages of Zheng He.', ""The Ming dynasty also engaged in a thriving trade with both Europe and Japan. The amount of silver flowing into the Ming dynasty was estimated by Joseph Needham at 300 million taels, which is equivalent to more than 190 billion dollars in today's money. In addition to silver, the Ming also imported many European firearms, in order to ensure the modernness of their weapons."", ""Although images of autarkic farmers who had no connection to the rest of China may have some merit for the earlier Han and T'ang dynasties, this was certainly not the case for the Ming dynasty. During the Ming dynasty, the increase in population and the decrease in quality land made it necessary that farmers make a living off cash crops. Many of these markets appeared in the rural countryside, where goods were exchanged and bartered.[6]"", 'During the Ming, the controls imposed on the economy were gradually relaxed. State monopolies on salt and iron ended as these and other industries were privatized. Taxes were reduced from the high levels under the Mongol Yuan, and the Ming had one of the lowest tax rates (per person) in the world. The entire foreign trade, which was estimated at up to 300 million taels, provided the Ming with a tax of only about 40,000 taels a year', 'The third type of market was the ""national market"" which was developed during the Song dynasty but particularly enhanced during the Ming. This market involved not only the exchange described above, but also products produced directly for the market. Unlike earlier dynasties, many Ming peasants were no longer producing only products they needed; many of them produced products for the market, which then they sold at a profit.[6]\nTrade and investment[edit]\nMain article: Haijin', 'Rural markets during the Ming[edit]\nMing agriculture was much changed from the earlier areas; firstly, gigantic areas, devoting and specializing in cash crops, sprung up to demand from the new market economy. Secondly, agricultural tools and carts, some water-powered, help to create a gigantic agricultural surplus which formed the basis of the rural economy. Besides rice, other crops were grown on a large scale.[5]', 'Investment and capital moved off the land and were poured into ventures. Continuing the trend from the Song, Ming investors poured large amounts of capital into ventures and reaped high profits. Many Chinese scholars believe the Ming was the dynasty in which the ""sprouts of capitalism"" emerged in China, only to be suppressed by the Qing Dynastry. This theory was widely promoted by Communist scholars during the Maoist period, and suffers from that period\'s general condemnation of the Manchu Qing, who were accused of mis-managing the Chinese state in the face of foreign encroachment.']",No answer

Brownlow, the ""elected"" governor of Tennessee, was inaugurated on April 5, 1865. The official Tennessee Blue Book does not include East in its list of former governors.', ""The governor's term in office is limited by the Tennessee state constitution. The first constitution, enacted in 1796, set a term of two years for the governor and provided that no person could serve as governor for more than six years in any eight-year period.[2] The term of office was lengthened to four years, without the possibility of consecutive terms, by constitutional amendments adopted in 1953.[3] Under the current provisions of the state constitution, as amended in 1978, the governor is elected to a four-year term and may serve no more than two terms consecutively.[3][4]"", ""Some presidents have had significant careers after leaving office. Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as Chief Justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover's work on government reorganization after World War II. Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for seventeen years, and Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875"", 'For a period of nearly five decades in the 20th century, the Tennessee Democratic Party held the Tennessee governorship continuously.

When the election was thrown to the House of Representatives, Henry Clay backed John Quincy Adams to deny the presidency to Andrew Jackson, a longtime political rival. Jackson defeated Adams in 1828 and in the next election the first Democratic national convention took place in Baltimore, Maryland on May 21–23, 1832.

The computer could be run from batteries, and was equipped with a 320×200-pixel electroluminescent display and 384\xa0kilobyte bubble memory. It was not IBM-compatible, and its high price (US$8,000–10,000) limited it to specialized applications. However, it was used heavily by the U.S', 'Two other noteworthy early laptops were the Sharp PC-5000 and the Gavilan SC, announced in 1983 but first sold in 1984. The Gavilan was notably the first computer to be marketed as a ""laptop"". It was also equipped with a pioneering touchpad-like pointing device, installed on a panel above the keyboard. Like the GRiD Compass, the Gavilan and the Sharp were housed in clamshell cases, but they were partly IBM-compatible, although primarily running their own system software.

The third model of this development, Compaq Portable II, featured high resolution graphics on its tube display. It was the first portable computer ready to be used on the shop floor, and for CAD and diagram display. It established Compaq as a major brand on the market.\nEpson HX-20[edit]', 'Kaypro 2000[edit]\nPossibly the first commercial IBM-compatible laptop was the Kaypro 2000, introduced in 1985. With its brushed aluminum clamshell case, it was remarkably similar in design to modern laptops. It featured a 25 line by 80 character LCD, a detachable keyboard, and a pop-up 90\xa0mm (3.5-inch) floppy drive.\nIBM PC Convertible[edit]\nAlso among the first commercial IBM-compatible laptops was the IBM PC Convertible, introduced in 1986. It had a CGA-compatible LCD and 2 floppy drives. It weighed 13 pounds (5.9\xa0kg).\nToshiba T1100, T1000, and T1200[edit]', 'The first Apple Computer machine designed to be used on the go was the 1989 Macintosh Portable (although an LCD screen had been an option for the transportable Apple IIc in 1984). Unlike the Compaq LTE laptop released earlier in the year the Macintosh Portable was actually a ""luggable"" not a laptop, but the Mac Portable was praised for its clear active matrix display and long battery life, but was a poor seller due to its bulk', 'The NEC UltraLite, released in mid-1989, was perhaps the first ""notebook"" computer, weighing just 2\xa0kg (4.4\xa0lbs). In lieu of a floppy or hard drive, it contained a 2\xa0megabyte RAM drive, but this reduced its utility as well as its size.

173,what is the role of hcl in the stomach,"Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach plays a key role in digestion by activating digestive enzymes, denaturing proteins, and creating a highly acidic environment that inhibits microbial growth. It also facilitates the breakdown of proteins into amino acids through proteolysis.","['Gastric acid, gastric juice or stomach acid, is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids. Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed', 'The main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid which is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the gastric glands in the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5[1] in the human stomach lumen, the acidity being maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase', 'The stomach is a major organ of the gastrointestinal tract and digestive system. It is a consistently J-shaped organ joined to the esophagus at its upper end and to the duodenum at its lower end. Gastric acid (informally gastric juice), produced in the stomach plays a vital role in the digestive process, and mainly contains hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride. A peptide hormone, gastrin, produced by G cells in the gastric glands, stimulates the production of gastric juice which activates the digestive enzymes', ""The highly acidic environment in the stomach lumen causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure (or denature). This exposes the protein's peptide bonds. The gastric chief cells of the stomach secrete enzymes for protein breakdown (inactive pepsinogen, and in infancy rennin). Hydrochloric acid activates pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin, which then helps digestion by breaking the bonds linking amino acids, a process known as proteolysis. In addition, many microorganisms have their growth inhibited by such an acidic environment, which is helpful to prevent infection."", '. Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate, a base, to buffer the fluid, ensuring that it does not become too acidic. These cells also produce mucus, which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract.', 'Role in disease[edit]\nIn hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria, there is low or no gastric acid in the stomach, potentially leading to problems as the disinfectant properties of the gastric lumen are decreased. In such conditions, there is greater risk of infections of the digestive tract (such as infection with Vibrio or Helicobacter bacteria).\nIn Zollinger–Ellison syndrome and hypercalcemia, there are increased gastrin levels, leading to excess gastric acid production, which can cause gastric ulcers.', '8 References\n9 External links\nSecretion[edit]\nA typical adult human stomach will secrete about 1.5 liters of gastric acid daily.[2] Gastric acid secretion happens in several steps. Chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi. Gastric acid is then secreted into the lumen of the gastric gland and gradually reaches the main stomach lumen.[2] The exact manner in which the secreted acid reaches the stomach lumen is controversial, as acid must first cross the relatively pH neutral gastric mucus layer.', '. Digestion is helped by the mastication of food by the teeth and also by the muscular actions of peristalsis and segmentation contractions. Gastric juice in the stomach is essential for the continuation of digestion as is the production of mucus in the stomach.', ""In the small intestine, the pH becomes crucial; it needs to be finely balanced in order to activate digestive enzymes. The chyme is very acidic, with a low pH, having been released from the stomach and needs to be made much more alkaline. This is achieved in the duodenum by the addition of bile from the gall bladder combined with the bicarbonate secretions from the pancreatic duct and also from secretions of bicarbonate-rich mucus from duodenal glands known as Brunner's glands"", 'HCl + NaHCO3 → NaCl + H2CO3\nThe carbonic acid rapidly equilibrates with carbon dioxide and water through catalysis by carbonic anhydrase enzymes bound to the gut epithelial lining,[6] leading to a net release of carbon dioxide gas within the lumen associated with neutralisation. In the absorptive upper intestine, such as the duodenum, both the dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid will tend to equilibrate with the blood, leading to most of the gas produced on neutralisation being exhaled through the lungs.\nRole in disease[edit]']","plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids"

Another account suggests he choked while eating grapes at the Anthesteria festival in Athens', 'Sophocles, the son of Sophilus, was a wealthy member of the rural deme (small community) of Hippeios Colonus in Attica, which was to become a setting for one of his plays, and he was probably born there.[2][7] Sophocles was born a few years before the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC: the exact year is unclear, although 497/6 is the most likely.[2][8] Sophocles was born into a wealthy family (his father was an armour manufacturer) and was highly educated', 'The most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone: they are generally known as the Theban plays, although each play was actually a part of a different tetralogy, the other members of which are now lost.

Source: [1]","['Revelation\nNew Testament manuscripts\nv\nt\ne\nThe Epistle to the Galatians, often shortened to Galatians, is the ninth book of the New Testament. It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Scholars have suggested that this is either the Roman province of Galatia in southern Anatolia, or a large region defined by an ethnic group of Celtic people in central Anatolia.[1]', 'Paul\'s letter is addressed ""to the churches of Galatia"" (Galatians 1:2), but the location of these churches is a matter of debate. A minority of scholars have argued that the ""Galatia"" is an ethnic reference to a Celtic people living in northern Asia Minor, but most agree that it is a geographical reference to the Roman province in central Asia Minor, which had been settled by immigrant Celts in the 270s BC and retained Gaulish features of culture and language in Paul\'s day', 'South Galatian view[edit]\nThe South Galatian view holds that Paul wrote Galatians before or shortly after the First Jerusalem Council, probably on his way to it, and that it was written to churches he had presumably planted during either his time in Tarsus (he would have traveled a short distance, since Tarsus is in Cilicia) after his first visit to Jerusalem as a Christian,[14] or during his first missionary journey, when he traveled throughout southern Galatia. If it was written to the believers in South Galatia, it would likely have been written in 49.[15]\nEarliest epistle[edit]', 'Paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding Gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law during the Apostolic Age. Paul argues that the Gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of the revelation of Christ. Galatians has exerted enormous influence on the history of Christianity, the development of Christian theology, and the study of the apostle Paul.[2]\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Composition\n1.1 Authenticity\n1.2 Galatia\n1.2.1 North Galatian view\n1.2.2 South Galatian view', ""Main article: Authorship of the Pauline Epistles\nBiblical scholars agree that Galatians is a true example of Paul's writing. The main arguments in favor of the authenticity of Galatians include its style and themes, which are common to the core letters of the Pauline corpus.[citation needed] Moreover, Paul's possible description of the Council of Jerusalem (Gal.2:1–10) gives a different point of view from the description in Acts 15:2–29, if it is, in fact, describing the Jerusalem Council.[7]"", ""In the first two chapters, Paul discusses his life before Christ and his early ministry, including interactions with other apostles in Jerusalem. This is the most extended discussion of Paul's past that we find in the Pauline letters (cf. Philippians 3:1–7).[23] Some have read this autobiographical narrative as Paul's defense of his apostolic authority (1:11–19; 2:1–14).[24] Others, however, see Paul's telling of the narrative as making an argument to the Galatians about the nature of the gospel and the Galatians' own situation.[25]"", 'Chapter 3 exhorts the Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in Jesus. Paul engages in an exegetical argument, drawing upon the figure of Abraham and the priority of his faith to the covenant of circumcision. Paul explains that the law was introduced as a temporary measure, one that is no longer efficacious now that the seed of Abraham, Christ, has come. Chapter 4 then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed and with the benediction, followed by 5:1–6:10 teaching about the right use of their Christian freedom.', '. Acts of the Apostles records Paul traveling to the ""region of Galatia and Phrygia"", which lies immediately west of Galatia.[9]', ""Accounts of the council are found in Acts of the Apostles chapter 15 (in two different forms, the Alexandrian and Western versions) and also possibly in Paul's letter to the Galatians chapter 2.[1] Some scholars dispute that Galatians 2 is about the Council of Jerusalem (notably because Galatians 2 describes a private meeting) while other scholars dispute the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Historical background\n2 Issues and outcome\n3 Historicity\n4 Interpreting the Council's decision\n4.1 Modern interpretation\n4.1.1 Circumcision\n5 See also\n6 Footnotes"", '^ Whether or not Galatians 2:1–10 is a record of the Council of Jerusalem or a different event is not agreed. Paul writes of laying his gospel before the others ""privately,"" not as in a Council. It has been argued that Galatians was written as Paul was on his way to the Council (see Paul the Apostle).

187,a best alternative to a negotiated agreement (batna),"The Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) is the most advantageous course of action a party can take if negotiations fail. It serves as a point of leverage in negotiations and helps ensure that parties do not accept worse resolutions than their BATNA. Negotiators must research and invest time in understanding their real options to avoid poor or faulty decisions. They should also consider the other party’s BATNA and compare it to their own offer. [1, 2]","['In negotiation theory, the best alternative to a negotiated agreement or BATNA is the most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator. A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA. Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, time value of money and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain', ""The BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations.

Citation: [Context provided].,"['After his defeat, Bruce Wayne enlists the aid of Dr. Shondra Kinsolving to rehabilitate him and asks Jean-Paul Valley to take up the mantle of Batman so that Gotham has a protector. Tim Drake argues with Bruce to allow Dick Grayson (the former Robin and then-current Nightwing) to become Batman, as he is more experienced and mentally competent. Bruce replies that Grayson has his own responsibilities and would only take up the mantle of the Bat reluctantly (Dick later expressed resentment at not being asked to stand in as Batman)', '""Knightfall"" is a 1993-1994 Batman story arc published by DC Comics. It consists of a trilogy of storylines that ran from 1993 to 1994, consisting of ""Knightfall"", ""Knightquest"", and ""KnightsEnd"".[note 1] The story takes place over approximately six months. Bruce Wayne (Batman) suffers burnout and is systematically assaulted and crippled by a ""super steroid""-enhanced genius named Bane. Wayne is replaced as Batman by an apprentice named Jean-Paul Valley (a.k.a. Azrael), who becomes increasingly violent and unstable, tarnishing Batman\'s reputation', '""KnightsEnd"" was collected into a trade paperback about a year later.

It is an election year, and Armand Krol is campaigning for re-election as mayor both before and after the story arc."", '""Knightfall"" was immediately followed by ""Knightquest"" in the monthly serials. ""Knightquest"" is divided into two storylines, one following Bruce Wayne (""Knightquest: The Search"") and the other on the new Batman (""Knightquest: The Crusade""). The stories were not treated as crossovers and the Batman titles continued as they had before ""Knightfall"" where the creative teams each pursued its own storyline. Instead of a crossover, ""Knightquest"" was more of an umbrella title that also encompassed some issues of Batman: Shadow of the Bat', '""Knightfall"" resulted in long-term ramifications for the Batman continuity, as Batman\'s trust from the police, the public, and fellow superheroes had to be rebuilt, due to Azrael\'s violence. Additionally, Wayne realizes the peril and burden of attempting to work in solitude, leading to the eventual creation of the modern incarnation of the Batman family. The events of Knightfall also led to the resignation of Wayne\'s loyal butler, Alfred Pennyworth.', 'Within the regular series, the buildup to ""Knightfall"" begins with a six-issue run in Batman #484-489 (September 1992 - February 1993), in which Batman (at the onset of a personal psychological mid-life crisis) is forced to deal, in rapid succession, with the returning villain Black Mask and his gang (who target Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox), a crazed killer called Metalhead, and a sharpshooter assassin hired by an imprisoned mobster to murder Commissioner Gordon. Batman begins to feel he has lost his edge, especially after his failure to capture Black Mask', ""Art by Mike Gustovich.\nBruce reaffirms his partnership with Tim, resolving the tension caused by Bruce's unwillingness to accept help during the Arkham prison break. Bruce passes the mantle of Batman to Grayson so he can re-evaluate what it will take to restore his aura of invincibility.

""Knightfall"" started almost immediately after the ""Funeral For a Friend"" storyline in the Superman books. During the breakout at Arkham Asylum, Batman and Robin both wear a black arm band with the S-shield engraved on it. The two stories involved DC Comics\'s most prominent characters', 'Film[edit]\nIn Justice League: Doom, Bane makes reference to the storyline when he confronts Bruce Wayne above his parents\' empty graves, stating: ""When we fought before, I broke the bat. Today... I break the man.""\nThe Dark Knight Rises is partially based on the ""Knightfall"" story arc. In it, Alfred resigns as Bruce\'s butler, Bane releases hundreds of criminals; and when Bane and Batman first meet, Bane brutally defeats and cripples him by striking Batman\'s back with his knee, mirroring the events of the Knightfall saga.\nVideo Games[edit]']",Jean-Paul Valley (a.k.a.

197,the settlers were attracted to oregon for all of the following reasons except,No answer,"['. Settlers emigrating from the eastern United States were spurred by various motives, among them religious persecution, economic incentives, and the prospect of new wealth and new freedoms in what was then a largely unspoiled and unregulated country. By the 1840s, several popular and well-established routes had been blazed through the continental interior to destinations in the far west, including the Oregon Trail, California Trail, and Mormon Trail. After the end of the Mexican–American War in 1849, vast new American conquests again enticed mass immigration', "". It was the only practical way for settlers in wagons without tools, livestock, or supplies to cross the mountains and usually thought critical to the colonization of the American West. Some of the first to travel the Oregon Trail were Christian missionaries, members of the Methodist Episcopal Church who established the Methodist Mission in 1834. Even though they didn't make many converts, they were impressed by the short amount of time needed to reach the Pacific Coast. Rumors about how the sun always shone there and wheat grew as tall as a man attracted American settlers."", 'The most common vehicle for Oregon and California-bound settlers was a covered wagon pulled by a team of oxen or mules (which were greatly preferred for their endurance and strength over horses) in the dry semi-arid terrain common to the high plains in the heat of summer. In later years, following the advice of Brigham Young, many Mormon emigrants made the crossing to Utah with handcarts', '. Legislation like the Donation Land Claim Act and significant events like the California Gold Rush further lured colonists to travel overland to the west.', 'Families usually began their journey at Independence, Missouri, near the Missouri River with the best time to travel being from April to September. The journey to cross the entire Oregon Trail in a covered wagon took from four to six months, following a winding trail 2,000 miles (3,200\xa0km) through prairies, deserts, and across mountains to the Pacific Northwest. The journey was a severe test of strength and endurance so travelers often joined wagon trains traveling about 12–15 miles (19–24\xa0km) per day. Settlers often had to cross flooded rivers', "". The raiders went outside at night to drill and get fresh air.

However, settlers discovered that the wine made from the various native grapes had flavors which were unfamiliar and which they did not like.', '. It also allowed for a much greater population density. The development of agriculture in Mesopotamia required many labourers to build and maintain its irrigation system. This, in turn, led to political hierarchy, bureaucracy, and religious sanction, along with standing armies to protect the emergent civilization. Intensified agriculture allowed for population increase, but also led to deforestation in upstream areas with resultant flooding and over-irrigation, which raised soil salinity']",No answer

It is assessed when a member of the defending team spends more than three seconds in the free throw lane (also known as the 16-foot lane, or colloquially as ""in the paint"") while not actively guarding an opponent. To be considered actively guarding, a defender must be within arm\'s length of an opponent and in a guarding position.[1] A three-second count is suspended if:[2][clarification needed]', 'Prior to the 2001–2002 NBA season, any form of zone defense was considered an illegal defense violation and resulted in a warning on the first violation and then a technical foul for any subsequent violations.[5] However, the defensive three-second violation makes it difficult for NBA defenses to play zone, since zone defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration.[6] The Philippine Basketball Association used to follow the illegal defense rule until the 2003 PBA season when it was abolished', 'a player is in the act of shooting\nthere is a loss of team control\nthe defender is actively guarding an opponent\nthe defender clears the painted area\nit is imminent the defender will become legal\nIn addition, a player guarding an opponent with the ball may be in the paint without actively guarding the opponent.[3]\nThe team committing a defensive three-second violation is assessed a team technical foul.

200,where does the optic nerve cross the midline ​,The optic nerve crosses the midline at the optic chiasm.,"['6 References\n7 External links\nStructure[edit]\nThe optic nerve fibres on the nasal sides of each retina cross over (decussate) to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm (decussation of medial fibers). The temporal hemiretina, on the other hand, stays on the same side. The inferonasal retina are related to anterior portion of the optic chiasm whereas superonasal retinal fibers are related to the posterior portion of the optic chiasm.', 'The crossing over of optic nerve fibres at the optic chiasm allows the visual cortex to receive the same hemispheric visual field from both eyes. Superimposing and processing these monocular visual signals allow the visual cortex to generate binocular and stereoscopic vision. For example, the right visual cortex receives the temporal visual field from the left eye, and the nasal visual field from the right eye, which results in the right visual cortex producing a binocular image of the left hemispheric visual field', '. The net result of optic nerve crossing over at the optic chiasm is for the right cerebral hemisphere to sense and process left hemispheric vision, and for the left cerebral hemisphere to sense and process right hemispheric vision.[4]', '[edit on Wikidata]\nThe optic chiasm or optic chiasma ( /ɒptɪk kaɪæzəm/; Greek χίασμα, ""crossing"", from the Greek χιάζω \'to mark with an X\', after the Greek letter \'Χ\', chi) is the part of the brain where the optic nerves partially cross. The optic chiasm is located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus.[1] The optic chiasm is found in all vertebrates, although in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) it is located within the brain.[2][3]\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Structure\n2 Other animals\n3 Additional images\n4 History\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nStructure[edit]', 'This crossing is an adaptive feature of frontally oriented eyes, found mostly in predatory animals requiring precise visual depth perception. (Prey animals, with laterally positioned eyes, have little binocular vision, so there is a more complete crossover of visual signals[citation needed].) Beyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, the optic nerves become optic tracts. The signals are passed on to the lateral geniculate body, in turn giving them to the occipital cortex (the outer matter of the rear brain).[5]\nOther animals[edit]', 'In the transfer of visual signals to the brain, the visual pathway, the retina is vertically divided in two, a temporal (nearer to the temple) half and a nasal (nearer to the nose) half. The axons from the nasal half cross the brain at the optic chiasma to join with axons from the temporal half of the other eye before passing into the lateral geniculate body.', 'The optic nerve is a central tract of many axons of ganglion cells connecting primarily to the lateral geniculate body, a visual relay station in the diencephalon (the rear of the forebrain). It also projects to the superior colliculus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the nucleus of the optic tract. It passes through the other layers, creating the optic disc in primates.[10]', 'Rods, cones and nerve layers in the retina. The front (anterior) of the eye is on the left. Light (from the left) passes through several transparent nerve layers to reach the rods and cones (far right). A chemical change in the rods and cones send a signal back to the nerves. The signal goes first to the bipolar and horizontal cells (yellow layer), then to the amacrine cells and ganglion cells (purple layer), then to the optic nerve fibres. The signals are processed in these layers. First, the signals start as raw outputs of points in the rod and cone cells', 'Optic chiasm - Wikipedia\n \nOptic chiasm \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nFor other meanings of ""chiasm"", see Chiasm.\nOptic chiasma\nBrain viewed from below; the front of the brain is above.
