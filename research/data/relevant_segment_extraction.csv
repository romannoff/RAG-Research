Muscle relaxation and inhibition of muscle contraction in vertebrates is obtained only by inhibition of the motor neuron itself. Muscle innervation may eventually play a role in the maturation of motor activity. This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on the motor neurons that innervate muscles (by decreasing their electrophysiological activity) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions, rather than on the muscles themselves.', 'Special visceral motor neurons[edit]\nThese are also known as branchial motor neurons, which are involved in facial expression, mastication, phonation, and swallowing.

The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming', '. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.[7]', 'The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing.

India launched its First FYP in 1951, immediately after independence under socialist influence of first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.[3]', 'The First Five-Year Plan was one of the most important because it had a great role in the launching of Indian development after Independence. Thus, it strongly supported agriculture production and it also launched the industrialization of the country (but less than the Second Plan, which focused on heavy industries).

6,what is the first step in the evolution of the eye,The first step in the evolution of the eye is the emergence of a patch of photoreceptor cells.,"['He suggested a stepwise evolution from ""an optic nerve merely coated with pigment, and without any other mechanism"" to ""a moderately high stage of perfection"", and gave examples of existing intermediate steps.[5] Darwin\'s suggestions were soon shown to be correct, and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution.[6]', ""Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors.[7] Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classical paper how many generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates.[8] Another researcher, G.C. Young, has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions, based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through.[9] All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin's theory.\nRate of evolution[edit]"", 'Rate of evolution[edit]\nThe first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period (about 540\xa0million years ago).[10] The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the ""Cambrian explosion"". One of the many hypotheses for ""causes"" of the Cambrian explosion is the ""Light Switch"" theory of Andrew Parker: It holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution.[11] Before the Cambrian explosion, animals may have sensed light, but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision.', 'The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate, because the fossil record, particularly of the lower Cambrian, is poor. How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation, relative advantage to the organism, and natural selection. However, the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year, which is common in small animals', '. Even with these pessimistic values, the vertebrate eye would still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years.[12][note 1]', 'Evolution of the eye - Wikipedia\n \nEvolution of the eye \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nMajor stages in the evolution of the eye in vertebrates.', 'The evolution of the eye is attractive to study, because the eye distinctively exemplifies an analogous organ found in many animal forms. Complex, image-forming eyes have evolved independently several times.[1] The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion. According his theory, the genes engaged with photoreceptor cells (so called Pax 6 genes) appeared probably at once in the life history, at a very early stage of the evolution', '. [2] Probably, the complex, image forming kinds of eyes are at least five: Chidaria - lens eye, complex eye; Molluscs - lens eye, everse retina; Annelids- lens eye, everse retina; Arthropods - facet eye; Vertebrate- lens eye, inverse retina [3]', 'Complex eyes appeared first within the few million years of the Cambrian explosion. From before the Cambrian, no evidence of eyes has survived, but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian, and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale.[4] Eyes are adapted to the various requirements of their owners. They vary in their visual acuity, the range of wavelengths they can detect, their sensitivity in low light, their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects, and whether they can discriminate colours.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 History of research\n2 Rate of evolution', '1 History of research\n2 Rate of evolution\n3 One origin or many?\n4 Stages of eye evolution\n4.1 Early eyes\n4.2 Lens formation and diversification\n4.3 Other developments\n4.3.1 Color vision\n4.3.2 Polarization vision\n4.3.3 Focusing mechanism\n4.3.4 Location\n5 Evolutionary baggage\n6 Footnotes\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 Further reading\n10 External links\nHistory of research[edit]\nThe human eye, showing the iris']",photoreceptor proteins that sense light

This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance → increase in the carrying capacity of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster technological advance → hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.[122] The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition."", 'According to the Russian demographer Sergey Kapitsa,[123] the world population grew between 67,000 BC and 1965 according to the following formula:\nN\n=\nC\nτ\narccot\n\u2061\nT\n0\n−\nT\nτ\n{\\displaystyle N={\\frac {C}{\\tau }}\\operatorname {arccot} {\\frac {T_{0}-T}{\\tau }}}\nwhere\nN is current population\nT is the current year\nC = (1.86±0.01)·1011\nT0 = 2007±1\nτ\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n = 42±1\nYears for world population to double[edit]', 'Years for world population to double[edit]\nAccording to linear interpolation and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates, the world population has doubled, or will double, in the years listed in the tables below (with two different starting points).

(or BS)); \xa0Listen\xa0(help·info))is the historical Hindu calendar of India and Nepal. It uses lunar months and solar sidereal year (see: Vedic time keeping). It is used as the official calendar in Nepal.\nThe Vikram Samvat has two alternative systems. It started in 56 BCE in southern (purnimanta) and 57–56 BCE in northern (amanta) systems of Hindu calendar. The Shukla Paksha in both systems coincides, most festivals occur in the Shukla Paksha. The era is named after King Vikramaditya of India.[1][2]', 'The lunisolar Vikram Samvat calendar is 56.7 years ahead (in count) of the solar Gregorian calendar. For example, the year 2074 VS began in 2017 CE and will end in 2018 CE.', 'The Rana rulers of Nepal made Vikram Samvat the official Hindu calendar in 1901 CE, which started as Samvat 1958.[3] In Nepal, the new year begins with the first day of the month of Baishakh, which usually falls within the months of April–May in the Gregorian calendar. The first day of the new year is passionately celebrated in a historical carnival that takes place every year in Bhaktapur, called Bisket Jatra.As before, from 2007 AD Nepal Sambat is recognized as the national calender.', ""In India, the reformulated Saka Calendar is officially used (although not for computing the dates of the traditional festivals), although in the Hindi version of the Preamble of the Constitution of India, the date of adoption of the constitution, 26 November 1949, is presented in Vikram Samvat (Margsheersh Shukla Saptami Samvat 2006).

It occurs in mid-April each year, and coincides with the traditional new year in Assam, Bengal, Burma, Cambodia, Kerala, Kashmir, Manipur, Odisha, Punjab, Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu and Thailand.', ""In addition to Nepal, the Vikram Samvat calendar is also recognized in North and East India, and in Gujarat among Hindus. In Buddhist communities, the month of Baishakh is associated with Vesak or Buddha's Birthday. It commemorates the birth, Enlightenment and passing of Gautama Buddha on the first full moon day in May, except in a leap year when the festival is held in June"", '. Although this festival is not held on the same day as Pahela Baishakh, the holidays typically fall in the same month (Baishakh) of the Bengali, Hindu, and Theravada Buddhist calendars, and are related historically through the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism in South Asia.', 'In Gujarat, the second day of Diwali is celebrated as the first day of the Vikram Samvat calendar which is the first day of the month Kartik.[11]\nConverting Vikram Samvat to CE[edit]\nWhile an approximate conversion can be made by subtracting 56 or 57, a precise computation requires identification of the version of Vikam Samvat that was used:\nYear expired (default) or current\nKartikadi (older or western India) or Chaitradi (modern Northern India). Kartikadi starts 7 months later in Kartika. Until 12th century Kartikadi year was common even in North India.', 'Months Amanta (south) or Purminata (North). Amanta Chaitra Krishna Paksha is Purminata Vaishakh Krishna Paksha. For the Shukla Paksh, the month is the same.\nSoftware named Pancanga is available to make the calculations.[12]\nThus the date Vikram 1208 (Kartikadi, expired), Vaishakh Krishna 5 (Purnimanta), Thursday, is equivalent to Vikram 1209 (Chaitradi, expired), Chaitra Krishna 5 (Amanta), and to Thursday March 27, 1152.[13]\nSee also[edit]\nBikrami calendar\nHindu calendars\nVira Nirvana Samvat\nReferences[edit]']",Nepal

For example, in www.example.com, ""www"" and ""example"" are labels, and ""com"" is the top-level domain.","['Domain name space\nToday, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages the top-level development and architecture of the Internet domain name space. It authorizes domain name registrars, through which domain names may be registered and reassigned.\nThe hierarchical domain name system, organized into zones, each served by domain name servers.\nThe domain name space consists of a tree of domain names. Each node in the tree holds information associated with the domain name. The tree sub-divides into zones beginning at the DNS root zone.\nDomain name syntax', 'Domain name syntax\nA domain name consists of one or more parts, technically called labels, that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com.\nThe right-most label conveys the top-level domain; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain com.', 'The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example: the label example specifies a node example.com as a subdomain of the com domain, and www is a label to create www.example.com, a subdomain of example.com. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot', '. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation.[5] Thus, when using a single character per label, the limit is 127 levels: 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253. In practice, some domain registries may have shorter limits.', 'A hostname is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address. For example, the domain names www.example.com and example.com are also hostnames, whereas the com domain is not. However, other top-level domains, particularly country code top-level domains, may indeed have an IP address, and if so, they are also hostnames.\nHostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name. A valid hostname is also a valid domain name, but a valid domain name may not necessarily be valid as a hostname.\nTop-level domains', 'A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes', '. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.[1]', 'Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs)', '. Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.', 'The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their services to the public.\nA fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted.

15,when did beds become popular in france and germany,"Feather pillows were first used as coverings in Germany in the 18th century, following French fashion trends. However, the specific date when beds became popular in France and Germany cannot be determined from the provided context. No answer","['Napoleon I\'s bed\nIn the 18th century feather pillows were first used as coverings in Germany, which in the fashions of the bed and the curious etiquette connected with the bedchamber followed France for the most part. The beds were a la duchesse, but in France itself there was great variety both of name and shape. The custom of the ""bed of justice"" upon which the king of France reclined when he was present in parliament, the princes being seated, the great officials standing, and the lesser officials kneeling, was held to denote the royal power even more than the throne.', 'Louis XI is credited with its first use and the custom lasted till the end of the monarchy. In the chambre de parade, where the ceremonial bed was placed, certain persons, such as ambassadors or great lords, whom it was desired to honour, were received in a more intimate fashion than the crowd of courtiers. At Versailles women received their friends in their beds, both before and after childbirth, during periods of mourning, and even directly after marriage—in fact in any circumstances which were thought deserving of congratulation or condolence', '. During the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used in high society in France till the end of the Ancien Régime. The earliest of which mention has been found belonged to Charles the Bold. They had curtains over a light framework, and were in their way as fine as the stationary beds.', ""Iron beds appear in the 18th century; the advertisements declare them as free from the insects which sometimes infested wooden bedsteads. Elsewhere, there was also the closed bed with sliding or folding shutters, and in England—where beds were commonly quite simple in form—the four poster was the usual citizen's bed until the middle of the 19th century.\nBed sizes\nMain article: Bed size"", 'Bed sizes\nMain article: Bed size\nBed sizes vary considerably around the world, with most countries having their own standards and terminology. While the ""double"" size appears to be standard among English speaking countries, based on the imperial measurement of 4\xa0ft 6\xa0in by 6\xa0ft 3\xa0in (137\xa0cm x 190\xa0cm), the sizes for other bed types tend to vary. The mainland European sizes differ, not merely because of the use of the metric system.[9]', 'In the 12th century, luxury increased and bedsteads were made of wood much decorated with inlaid, carved, and painted ornamentation. They also used folding beds, which served as couches by day and had cushions covered with silk laid upon leather. At night a linen sheet was spread and pillows placed, while silk-covered skins served as coverlets. The Carolingian manuscripts show metal bedsteads much higher at the head than at the feet, and this shape continued in use until the 13th century in France, many cushions being added to raise the body to a sloping position', '. In 12th-century manuscripts, the bedsteads appear much richer, with inlays, carving, and painting, and with embroidered coverlets and mattresses in harmony. Curtains were hung above the bed and a small hanging lamp is often shown.', 'In the 14th century the woodwork became of less importance, generally being entirely covered by hangings of rich materials. Silk, velvet, and even cloth of gold were frequently used. Inventories from the beginning of the 14th century give details of these hangings lined with fur and richly embroidered. It was then that the Four poster bed (also known as a tester bed) made its first appearance, the bed being slung from the ceiling or fastened to the walls, a form which developed later into a room within a room, shut in by double curtains, sometimes even to exclude all drafts', '. The space between bed and wall was called the ruelle, and very intimate friends were received there. The 14th century is also the time when feather beds became highly prized possessions.[8]', 'In the 15th century beds became very large, reaching 7 to 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4\xa0m) by 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1\xa0m). The mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks, straw, or feathers. At this time great personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property about with them, including beds and bed-hangings, and for this reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks to be covered up; but about the beginning of the 16th century bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative, since the lords remained in the same place for longer periods.\nRenaissance and modern Europe']",the 12th century

The term ""gymnosperm"" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, ""naked"" and σπέρμα sperma, ""seed""), meaning ""naked seeds"". The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary', '. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or solitary as in Yew, Torreya, Ginkgo.[1]', 'The gymnosperms and angiosperms together compose the spermatophytes or seed plants. The gymnosperms are divided into six phyla. Organisms that belong to the Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Gnetophyta, and Pinophyta (also known as Coniferophyta) phyla are still in existence while those in the Pteridospermales and Cordaitales phyla are now extinct.[2]', 'By far the largest group of living gymnosperms are the conifers (pines, cypresses, and relatives), followed by cycads, gnetophytes (Gnetum, Ephedra and Welwitschia), and Ginkgo biloba (a single living species). Roots in some genera have fungal association with roots in the form of mycorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised roots called coralloid roots are associated with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Classification\n2 Diversity and origin\n3 Uses\n4 Life cycle\n5 Genetics\n6 References\n7 External links\nClassification[edit]', 'Cycads are the next most abundant group of gymnosperms, with two or three families, 11 genera, and approximately 338 species. A majority of cycads are native to tropical climates and are most abundantly found in regions near the equator. The other extant groups are the 95-100 species of Gnetales and one species of Ginkgo.[2]\nUses[edit]\nGymnosperms have major economic uses. Pine, fir, spruce, and cedar are all examples of conifers that are used for lumber, paper production, and resin. Some other common uses for gymnosperms are soap, varnish, nail polish, food, gum, and perfumes.', 'Life cycle[edit]\nExample of gymnosperm lifecycle', 'Gymnosperms, like all vascular plants, have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle, which means they spend most of their life cycle with diploid cells, while the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived. Two spore types, microspores and megaspores, are typically produced in pollen cones or ovulate cones, respectively. Gametophytes, as with all heterosporous plants, develop within the spore wall. Pollen grains (microgametophytes) mature from microspores, and ultimately produce sperm cells. Megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule', '. Gymnosperms produce multiple archegonia, which produce the female gamete. During pollination, pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from the pollen cone to the ovule. Pollen is usually moved by wind or insects. Whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle. The pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms', '. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are moved along a pollen tube to the egg. After syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell), the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte). More than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed. The mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte, which serves as a food supply, and the seed coat.[16]']",either on the surface of scales or leaves

This makes him (including post season) one of only two players in NFL history (Bill Dudley being the other) to score a touchdown six different ways (interception return, punt return, kickoff return, receiving, rushing, and a fumble recovery).', ""On February 6, 2011, at Super Bowl XLV in Arlington, Texas, Sanders performed the pre-game coin toss.\nSanders did not attend classes or take final exams during the fall semester of his senior year at Florida State, yet played in the Sugar Bowl against Auburn. This caused the Florida State Legislature to create the 'Deion Sanders rule', whereby a football athlete at any state university could not play in a bowl game if he failed to successfully complete the previous semester.[30]"", ""In 1995, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a minimum yearly base salary and a nearly $13 million signing bonus in an attempt to circumvent the NFL's salary cap.

A posted speed limit may only apply to that road or to all roads beyond the sign that defines them depending on local laws', '. In the European Union, large signposts showing the national (default) speed limits of the respective country are usually erected immediately after border crossings, with a repeater sign some 200 to 500\xa0m (660 to 1,640\xa0ft) after the first sign. Some places provide an additional ""speed zone ahead"" ahead of the restriction and speed limit reminder signs may appear at regular intervals which may be painted on the road surface.', 'Signs are normally placed on both sides of the road and in some places there are small (less than 1/4 the size of the sign) rectangular orange reflector flags attached to both upper right corners of both signs. The speed limit sign marking the new speed zone may also have the orange flags; this practice can be observed in New York on highways where the speed limit varies such as New York State Route 17.\nSpeed limits on European Motorways in km/h', 'Speed limits on European Motorways in km/h\nSignage in many countries, especially in Europe, conforms to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals using black text with a red circle on a white background.', 'In the United States, the signs are usually rectangular with the words ""SPEED LIMIT"" and the values in black on a white background.

31,when are centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants used,"Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants are used for low back pain, neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches, and myofascial pain syndrome.

They may be used in combination with other therapies to provide additional benefits.","['Terminology[edit]\nBecause they may act at the level of the cortex, brain stem or spinal cord, or all three areas, they have traditionally been referred to as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants. However, it is now known not every agent in this class has CNS activity (e.g. dantrolene), so this name is inaccurate.[5]', 'Most sources still use the term ""centrally acting muscle relaxant"". According to MeSH, dantrolene is usually classified as a centrally acting muscle relaxant.[10] The World Health Organization, in its ATC, uses the term ""centrally acting agents"",[11] but adds a distinct category of ""directly acting agents"", for dantrolene.[12] Use of this terminology dates back to at least 1973.[13]\nThe term ""spasmolytic"" is also considered a synonym for antispasmodic.[14]\nClinical use[edit]', 'Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and methocarbamol are commonly prescribed for low back pain or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome.[15] However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),[16][17] and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants.[15] Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs', '.[18] In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use.[15] No drug has been shown to be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness.[15][17] Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use.[15] A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse-effect profile, tolerability, and cost.[19]', 'Muscle relaxants (according to one study) were not advised for orthopedic conditions, but rather for neurological conditions such as spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.[15] Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.\nMuscle relaxants are thought to be useful in painful disorders based on the theory that pain induces spasm and spasm causes pain. However, considerable evidence contradicts this theory.[18]', 'A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone. It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, and hyperreflexia. The term ""muscle relaxant"" is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics. Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system (CNS) activity. They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis', '. Spasmolytics, also known as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions. While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants,[1][2] the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only.[3][4]', 'Contents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 History\n2 Neuromuscular blockers\n3 Spasmolytics\n3.1 Terminology\n3.2 Clinical use\n3.3 Mechanism\n4 Side effects\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nHistory[edit]', 'The earliest known use of muscle relaxant drugs was by natives of the Amazon Basin in South America who used poison-tipped arrows that produced death by skeletal muscle paralysis. This was first documented in the 16th century, when European explorers encountered it. This poison, known today as curare, led to some of the earliest scientific studies in pharmacology. Its active ingredient, tubocurarine, as well as many synthetic derivatives, played a significant role in scientific experiments to determine the function of acetylcholine in neuromuscular transmission', '.[5] By 1943, neuromuscular blocking drugs became established as muscle relaxants in the practice of anesthesia and surgery.[6]']",to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions

Winemakers also cultivated vineyards in Oregon and Washington, on Long Island in New York, and numerous other new locales.', 'Americans became more educated about wines and increased their demand for high-quality wine. All 50 states now have some acreage in vineyard cultivation. By 2004, 668 million gallons (25.3 million hectoliters) of wine were consumed in the United States.[13] Today, the U.S. produces over 800 million gallons of wine a year, of which California produces more than 84%, followed by Washington, New York, Pennsylvania, and Oregon', '.

These sensory neurons are an exception to the typical neuron, in that they do not have separate dendrites and an axonal process, but rather one branched process that serves both functions.[2] The axon has a peripheral branch (from the cell body to the periphery: skin, joint and muscle) and a central branch (from the cell body to spinal cord).[1]\nIn the dorsal root ganglia[edit]', 'In the dorsal root ganglia[edit]\nThe soma (cell body) of each pseudounipolar neuron is located within a dorsal root ganglion.[2] The axon leaves the cell body (and out of the dorsal root ganglion) into the dorsal root, where it splits into two branches. The central branch goes to the posterior (dorsal) horn of the spinal cord, where it forms synapses with other neurons. The peripheral branch travels through the distal dorsal root into the spinal nerve all the way until skin, joint, and muscle.\nIn the sensory ganglia of cranial nerves[edit]', ""In the sensory ganglia of cranial nerves[edit]\nPseudounipolar neurons are also found in the sensory ganglia of cranial nerves V, VII, IX and X, all mixed-cranial nerves. The vestibulocochlear nerve, has the bipolar neuron type in both the spiral ganglion as well as Scarpa's ganglion.\nFunction[edit]\nSignal pathway[edit]"", ""Function[edit]\nSignal pathway[edit]\nThese neurons have sensory receptors on skin, joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. The area of the axon that is closest to the receptor is the trigger zone for the neuron.[3] The signal is conducted through the axon to the dorsal root ganglion's cell body, then through the axon and ending at the sensory nuclei in the posterior horn of the spinal cord.\nSee also[edit]\nBipolar neuron\nMultipolar neuron\nUnipolar neuron\nReferences[edit]"", 'Further specification of motor neurons occurs when retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, Wnts, and TGFb, are integrated into the various Hox transcription factors.

The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. The axons of these cells descend from the cortex to form the corticospinal tract.[10]\nWhite Matter Tract[edit]', 'White Matter Tract[edit]\nWhite matter tracts are bundles of axons and serve as means to propagate nerve impulses on a large scale. These are found in the spinal cord and appear white from the myelin surrounding axons. While these tracts exist for both efferent and afferent nerves, efferent nerves will carry signals down the spinal cord toward their effector target. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. There are seven major white matter motor tracts to be found in the spinal cord and are listed below:[11]\nLateral Corticospinal Tract\nRubrospinal Tract', 'Lateral Corticospinal Tract\nRubrospinal Tract\nLateral Reticulospinal Tract\nVestibulospinal tract\nMedial Reticulospinal Tract\nTectospinal Tract\nAnterior Corticospinal Tract\nLower Motor Neurons[edit]\nLower motor neurons are those that originate in the spinal cord and directly or indirectly innervate effector targets.

Menstrual management practices range from medical suppression of menstruation, through wearing special garments or other items, washing or avoidance of washing, disposal and laundry of stained materials, to separation of menstruators to particular places or activities.', 'Menstrual products (also called ""feminine hygiene"" products) are made to absorb or catch menstrual blood. A number of different products are available - some are disposable, some are reusable. Where women can afford it, items used to absorb or catch menses are usually commercially manufactured products.\nDisposable products\nDisposable sanitary napkin\nTampon in plastic applicator', 'Tampon in plastic applicator\nSanitary napkins (also called sanitary towels or pads) – Rectangular pieces of material worn attached to the underwear to absorb menstrual flow, often with an adhesive backing to hold the pad in place.

Some also use patented technology to be leak resistant, such as the brand THINX.\nSea sponges – Natural sponges, worn internally like a tampon to absorb menstrual flow.\nBlanket, towel – (also known as a draw sheet) – large reusable piece of cloth, most often used at night, placed between legs to absorb menstrual flow.\nNon-commercial items', 'Bleeding\nThe average volume of menstrual fluid during a monthly menstrual period is 35 milliliters (2.4 tablespoons of menstrual fluid) with 10–80 milliliters (1–6 tablespoons of menstrual fluid) considered typical. Menstrual fluid is the correct name for the flow, although many people prefer to refer to it as menstrual blood. Menstrual fluid contains some blood, as well as cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood.[10]:p. 381', 'About half of menstrual fluid is blood. This blood contains sodium, calcium, phosphate, iron, and chloride, the extent of which depends on the woman. As well as blood, the fluid consists of cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Vaginal fluids in menses mainly contribute water, common electrolytes, organ moieties, and at least 14 proteins, including glycoproteins.[22]', 'Many mature females notice blood clots during menstruation. These appear as clumps of blood that may look like tissue. If there are questions (for example, was there a miscarriage?), examination under a microscope can confirm if it was endometrial tissue or pregnancy tissue (products of conception) that was shed.[23] Sometimes menstrual clots or shed endometrial tissue is incorrectly thought to indicate an early-term miscarriage of an embryo. An enzyme called plasmin – contained in the endometrium – tends to inhibit the blood from clotting.', 'The amount of iron lost in menstrual fluid is relatively small for most women.[24] In one study, premenopausal women who exhibited symptoms of iron deficiency were given endoscopies. 86% of them actually had gastrointestinal disease and were at risk of being misdiagnosed simply because they were menstruating.[25] Heavy menstrual bleeding, occurring monthly, can result in anemia.\nMenstrual disorders', ""Menstrual disorders\nThere is a wide spectrum of differences in how women experience menstruation.

The date of the human discovery and habitation of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate.[52] Some archaeologists and historians think it was a later wave of immigrants from Tahiti around 1000 CE who introduced a new line of high chiefs, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the building of heiau', '.[citation needed] This later immigration is detailed in Hawaiian mythology (moʻolelo) about Paʻao.

Gibbs replies, ""Illya Kuryakin"".[11]', ""According to the behind-the-scenes feature on the 2006 DVD of NCIS season 1, McCallum became an expert in forensics to play Mallard, including appearing at medical examiner conventions. In the feature, Donald P.

48,what was the purpose of a revival meeting during the second great awakening,"The purpose of revival meetings during the Second Great Awakening was to enroll new members in existing evangelical denominations and lead to the formation of new denominations. They aimed to inspire individuals to repent and experience personal salvation through faith in Christ. These meetings served as social venues where participants could gather for fellowship and worship, experiencing emotional exhilaration and spiritual transformation.

The movement began around 1790, gained momentum by 1800 and, after 1820, membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1850s. The Second Great Awakening reflected Romanticism characterized by enthusiasm, emotion, and an appeal to the super-natural. It rejected the skeptical rationalism and deism of the Enlightenment.', 'The revivals enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[1]', 'Historians named the Second Great Awakening in the context of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s and of the Third Great Awakening of the late 1850s to early 1900s. These revivals were part of a much larger Romantic religious movement that was sweeping across Europe at the time, mainly throughout England, Scotland, and Germany.[2]\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Spread of revivals\n1.1 Background\n1.2 Theology\n1.3 Burned-over district\n1.4 West and Tidewater South\n1.5 West\n1.6 Church membership soars\n2 Subgroups\n2.1 Adventism\n2.2 Holiness movement\n2.3 Restoration Movement\n3 Culture and society', '2.3 Restoration Movement\n3 Culture and society\n4 Slaves and free Africans\n5 Women\n6 Prominent figures\n7 Political implications\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 Further reading\n10.1 Historiography\nSpread of revivals[edit]\nPart of a series on\nBaptists\nBackground[show]\nChristianity\nProtestantism\nPuritanism\nAnabaptism\nDoctrine[show]\nPriesthood of all believers\nIndividual soul liberty\nSeparation of church and state\nSola scriptura\nCongregationalism\nOrdinances\nOffices\nConfessions\nKey figures[show]\nJohn Smyth\nThomas Helwys\nRoger Williams\nJohn Clarke\nJohn Bunyan\nShubal Stearns\nAndrew Fuller\nCharles Spurgeon', ""These denominations were based on an interpretation of man's spiritual equality before God, which led them to recruit members and preachers from a wide range of classes and all races. Baptists and Methodist revivals were successful in some parts of the Tidewater in the South, where an increasing number of common planters, plain folk, and slaves were converted.\nWest[edit]\nMain article: Revival of 1800"", ""In the newly settled frontier regions, the revival was implemented through camp meetings. These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion, and they were important as social venues. The camp meeting was a religious service of several days' length with preachers. Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship. The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events"", "". The revivals followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis of the individual's sins and need to turn to Christ, restored by a sense of personal salvation. Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.[14] The Second Great Awakening marked a religious transition in society in America. Many Americans from the Calvinist sect emphasized man's inability to save themselves and that their only way to be saved was from grace from God.[15]"", 'The Revival of 1800 in Logan County, Kentucky, began as a traditional Presbyterian sacramental occasion. The first informal camp meeting began there in June, when people began camping on the grounds of the Red River Meeting House. Subsequent meetings followed at the nearby Gasper River and Muddy River congregations, all three under the ministry of James McGready. One year later, an even larger sacrament occasion was held at Cane Ridge, Kentucky under Barton Stone, attracting perhaps as many as 20,000 people. Numerous Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist ministers participated in the services', '. Thanks to such leaders as Barton W. Stone (1772–1844) and Alexander Campbell (1788–1866), the camp meeting revival became a major mode of church expansion for the Methodists and Baptists.[16]']",evangelizing

The optics of the eye create a focused two-dimentional image of the visual world on the retina, which translates that image into electrical neural impulses to the brain to create visual perception, the retina serving much the same function as film or a CCD in a camera.', 'The retina consists of several layers of neurons interconnected by synapses. The neural retina refers to the three layers of neural cells (photo receptor cells, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells) within the retina, which in its entirety comprises ten distinct layers, including an outer layer of pigmented epithelial cells. The only neural cells that are directly sensitive to light are the photoreceptor cells, which are of two types: rods and cones. Rods function mainly in dim light and provide black-and-white vision while cones are responsible for the perception of colour', '. A third type of photoreceptor, the photosensitive ganglion cells, is important for entrainment and reflexive responses to the brightness of light.', 'Light striking the retina initiates a cascade of chemical and electrical events that ultimately trigger nerve impulses that are sent to various visual centres of the brain through the fibres of the optic nerve. Neural signals from the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons, whose output takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve.[1] Several important features of visual perception can be traced to the retinal encoding and processing of light.', 'In vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and the optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, specifically the embryonic diencephalon; thus, the retina is considered part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue.[2][3] It is the only part of the CNS that can be visualized non-invasively.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Structure\n1.1 Inverted versus non-inverted retina\n1.2 Retinal layers\n1.2.1 Layers imagable with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)\n1.3 Development\n1.4 Blood supply\n1.4.1 Circulatory mechanisms\n1.4.1.1 In birds', 'The functional unit of the eye is the photoreceptor cell, which contains the opsin proteins and responds to light by initiating a nerve impulse. The light sensitive opsins are borne on a hairy layer, to maximise the surface area. The nature of these ""hairs"" differs, with two basic forms underlying photoreceptor structure: microvilli and cilia.[23] In the eyes of protostomes, they are microvilli: extensions or protrusions of the cellular membrane. But in the eyes of deuterostomes, they are derived from cilia, which are separate structures', '.[22] However, outside the eyes an organism may use the other type of photoreceptor cells, for instance the clamworm Platynereis dumerilii uses microvilliar cells in the eyes but has additionally deep brain ciliary photoreceptor cells.[24] The actual derivation may be more complicated, as some microvilli contain traces of cilia — but other observations appear to support a fundamental difference between protostomes and deuterostomes', '.[22] These considerations centre on the response of the cells to light – some use sodium to cause the electric signal that will form a nerve impulse, and others use potassium; further, protostomes on the whole construct a signal by allowing more sodium to pass through their cell walls, whereas deuterostomes allow less through.[22]', 'This suggests that when the two lineages diverged in the Precambrian, they had only very primitive light receptors, which developed into more complex eyes independently.\nEarly eyes[edit]', 'Early eyes[edit]\nThe basic light-processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell, a specialized cell containing two types of molecules in a membrane: the opsin, a light-sensitive protein, surrounding the chromophore, a pigment that distinguishes colors. Groups of such cells are termed ""eyespots"", and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times. These eyespots permit animals to gain only a very basic sense of the direction and intensity of light, but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings.[22]']",No answer

The manuscript of Gawain is known in academic circles as Cotton Nero A.x., following a naming system used by one of its owners, Robert Cotton, a collector of Medieval English texts.[3] Before the Gawain manuscript came into Cotton\'s possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile of Banke in Yorkshire', "".[6] Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton's History edited by Richard Price, it was almost entirely unknown. Even then, the Gawain poem was not published in its entirety until 1839.[7][8] Now held in the British Library, it has been dated to the late 14th century, meaning the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, though it is unlikely that they ever met"", '.[9] The three other works found in the same manuscript as Gawain (commonly known as Pearl, Patience, and Purity or Cleanliness) are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single authorship.[10]', ""What is known today about the poet is largely general. As J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon, after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:\nHe was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.[11]"", ""The most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire.[12] He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem St. Erkenwald, which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to Gawain. St. Erkenwald, however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.[10]\nVerse form[edit]""]",No answer
54,who said if a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it,"The phrase ""if a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it"" originates from a philosophical inquiry about the existence of sound without perceivers. No specific individual is attributed to having originally stated this exact phrase; however, it is commonly associated with metaphysical discussions about perception and reality.","['Some years later, a similar question is posed. It is unknown whether the source of this question is Berkeley or not. In June 1883 in the magazine The Chautauquan, the question was put, ""If a tree were to fall on an island where there were no human beings would there be any sound?"" They then went on to answer the query with, ""No. Sound is the sensation excited in the ear when the air or other medium is set in motion.""[4] This seems to imply that the question is posed not from a philosophical viewpoint, but from a purely scientific one', '. The magazine Scientific American corroborated the technical aspect of this question, while leaving out the philosophic side, a year later when they asked the question slightly reworded, ""If a tree were to fall on an uninhabited island, would there be any sound?"" And gave a more technical answer, ""Sound is vibration, transmitted to our senses through the mechanism of the ear, and recognized as sound only at our nerve centers. The falling of the tree or any other disturbance will produce vibration of the air. If there be no ears to hear, there will be no sound.""[5]', ""Albert Einstein is reported to have asked his fellow physicist and friend Niels Bohr, one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, whether he realistically believed that 'the moon does not exist if nobody is looking at it.' To this Bohr replied that however hard he (Einstein) may try, he would not be able to prove that it does, thus giving the entire riddle the status of a kind of an infallible conjecture—one that cannot be either proved or disproved."", 'The current phrasing appears to have originated in the 1910 book Physics by Charles Riborg Mann and George Ransom Twiss. The question ""When a tree falls in a lonely forest, and no animal is near by to hear it, does it make a sound? Why?"" is posed along with many other questions to quiz readers on the contents of the chapter, and as such, is posed from a purely physical point of view.[6]\nMetaphysics[edit]\nThe possibility of unperceived existence[edit]\nMain article: George Berkeley', 'Can something exist without being perceived? – e.g. ""is sound only sound if a person hears it?"" The most immediate philosophical topic that the riddle introduces involves the existence of the tree (and the sound it produces) outside of human perception. If no one is around to see, hear, touch or smell the tree, how could it be said to exist? What is it to say that it exists when such an existence is unknown? Of course, from a scientific viewpoint, it exists.[7] It is human beings that are able to perceive it', 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening - Wikipedia\n \nStopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\n""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" is a poem written in 1922 by Robert Frost, and published in 1923 in his New Hampshire volume.

Symbolically, because they remain with Dorothy throughout her quest, she is provided with both and need not select"", "".[1] The Tin Woodman states unequivocally that he has neither heart nor brain, but cares nothing for the loss of his brain. Towards the end of the novel, though, Glinda praises his brain as not quite that of the Scarecrow's."", 'The Wizard turns out to be a ""humbug"" and can only provide a placebo heart made of silk and filled with sawdust. However, this is enough to please the Tin Woodman, who, with or without a heart, was all along the most tender and emotional of Dorothy\'s companions (just as the Scarecrow was the wisest and the Cowardly Lion the bravest). When he accidentally crushes an insect, he is grief-stricken and, ironically, claims that he must be careful about such things, while those with hearts do not need such care', '. This tenderness remains with him throughout the series, as in The Patchwork Girl of Oz, where he refuses to let a butterfly be maimed for the casting of a spell.[2]', 'When Dorothy returns home to her farm in Kansas, the Tin Woodman returns to the Winkie Country to rule as emperor. Later, he has his subjects construct a palace made entirely of tin — from the architecture all the way down to the flowers in the garden.\nBaum emphasized that the Tin Woodman remains alive, in contrast to the windup mechanical man Tik-Tok Dorothy meets in a later book. Nick Chopper was not turned into a machine, but rather had his flesh body replaced by a metal one. Far from missing his original existence, the Tin Woodman is proud (perhaps too proud) of his untiring tin body.', 'In Oz Squad, Nick was shown in a sexual relationship with ""Rebecca Eastwitch"" in order to get closer to Nimmie Amee and attempt to elope with her.\nA darker twist to the beloved woodman is made by author James A. Owen in the fourth installment of his series, The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica when his identity is revealed to be Roger Bacon.[4]', 'The Tin Woodman appears in the 2011 TV series Once Upon a Time episode ""Where Bluebirds Fly"" portrayed by Austin Obiajunwa (as a teenager) and by Alex Désert (as an adult).[5] In this version he goes by the name Stanum (derived from the Latin word ""stannum"", which means ""tin"").', 'Since youth, Stanum has been a woodcutter and one day when he first met Zelena, the daughter of another woodsman, he finds out that Zelena has magic and befriends her, regardless of whatever the children say about Zelena, who they see as a freak. Many years later, Stanum, now a man, is punished by the Wicked Witch of the North for chopping down a tree in her domain, and his body slowly begins to transform into tin. To prevent himself from completely becoming tin, Stanum seeks out help from Zelena (now the Wicked Witch of the West) at the Emerald City of Oz', "". Zelena agrees to help him seek out the Crimson Heart, which can save him. During their quest, Stanum tells Zelena that she doesn't have to be lonely but she is doing her best to deny his advice. Suddenly, a lion comes of nowhere to attack Stanum, and Zelena uses her magic to make the lion go away (at this point the lion has become as Zelena would put it, cowardly). When they finally arrived to the location of the Crimson Heart, the two learned that the only way to make it work is through the absorption of another person's magic"", '. Unfortunately Zelena\'s actions and selfish greed for magic causes her to betray Stanum, whom she suspect was aligned with Dorothy by keeping the Crimson Heart for herself, leaving Stanum to transform into the Tin Man permanently. Some time later, when Robin Hood arrives in Oz in the episode ""Heart of Gold"", the Tin Man is seen on the side of the Yellow Brick Road, torn apart.']",the Tin Woodman
56,who is the guy who walked across the twin towers,The guy who walked across the Twin Towers is Philippe Petit.,"[""Before his Twin Towers walk, Petit was known to New Yorkers for his frequent tightrope-walking performances and magic shows in the parks of New York, especially Washington Square Park. Petit's most famous performance was in August 1974, conducted on a wire between the roofs of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan, a quarter mile above the ground. He performed for 45 minutes, making eight passes along the wire, during which he walked, danced, lay down on the wire, and saluted watchers from a kneeling position. Office workers, construction crews and policemen cheered him on."", 'Planning[edit]\nPetit conceived his ""coup"" when he was 18, when he first read about the proposed construction of the Twin Towers and saw drawings of the project in a magazine, which he read while sitting at a dentist\'s office in 1968.[5] Petit was seized by the idea of performing there, and began collecting articles on the Towers whenever he could.', 'What was called the ""artistic crime of the century"" took Petit six years of planning, during which he learned everything he could about the buildings and their construction. In the same period, he began to perform high wire walking at other famous places. Rigging his wire secretly, he performed as a combination of circus act and public display.

It is credited to Paracelsus who expressed the classic toxicology maxim ""All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison."" This is often condensed to: ""The dose makes the poison"" or in Latin, ""Sola dosis facit venenum"". It means that a substance can produce the harmful effect associated with its toxic properties only if it reaches a susceptible biological system within the body in a high enough concentration (i.e., dose)', '.e., dose).[2]', 'The principle relies on the finding that all chemicals—even water and oxygen—can be toxic if too much is eaten, drunk, or absorbed. ""The toxicity of any particular chemical depends on many factors, including the extent to which it enters an individual’s body.""[3] This finding provides also the basis for public health standards, which specify maximum acceptable concentrations of various contaminants in food, public drinking water, and the environment.[3]', 'However, there is no linear relationship and also more to chemical toxicity than the acute effects caused by short-term exposure. Relatively low doses of contaminants in water, food, and environment can already have significant chronic effects if there is a long-term exposure.[3] Many pollutants, drugs, and natural substances adhere to this principle by causing different effects at different levels, which can as a result lead to health standards that are either too strong or too weak.[4]', "".

60,what does the transfer case control module do,"The transfer case control module controls the engagement and disengagement of the transfer case, allowing the driver to switch between two-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive modes. It also synchronizes the rotation of the front and rear wheels to prevent damage and ensure smooth operation.","['The transfer case receives power from the transmission and sends it to both the front and rear axles. This can be done with gears, hydraulics, or chain drive. On some vehicles, such as four-wheel-drive trucks or vehicles intended for off-road use, this feature is controlled by the driver. The driver can put the transfer case into either ""two-wheel-drive"" or ""four-wheel-drive"" mode. This is sometimes accomplished by means of a shifter, similar to that in a manual transmission. On some vehicles this may be electronically operated by a switch instead', '. Some vehicles, such as all-wheel-drive sports cars, have transfer cases that are not selectable. Such a transfer case is permanently ""locked"" into all-wheel-drive mode.', 'Transfer cases that are designed to allow for normal road use synchronize the difference between the rotation of the front and rear wheels,[1] in much the same way the differential acts on a given axle. This is necessary because the front and rear tires never turn at the same speed. Different rates of tire rotation are generally due to different tire diameters (since front and rear tires inevitably wear at different rates) and different gear ratios in the front and rear differentials since manufacturers will often have a slightly lower ratio in the front vs', '. the rear to help with control (such as a 3.55:1 in the rear differential and a 3.54:1 in the front differential). If the transfer case did not make up the difference between the two different rates of rotation, binding would occur and the transfer case could become damaged. This is also why a transfer case that is not designed for on-road use must never be driven on dry pavement.', 'Transfer cases designed for off-road use can mechanically lock the front and rear axles when needed[2] (e.g. when one of the axles is on a slippery surfaces or stuck in mud, whereas the other has better traction). This is the equivalent to the differential lock.', 'Drive type[edit]\nGear-driven[edit]\nThere are two different types of internal power-transfer mechanism found in most transfer cases. Gear-driven transfer cases use sets of gears to drive either the front or both the front and rear driveshafts. These are generally strong, heavy units that are used in large trucks, but there are currently several gear drive cases in production for passenger cars.[citation needed]\nChain-driven[edit]', 'Chain-driven[edit]\nChain-driven transfer cases use a chain to drive most often only one axle, but can drive both axles. Chain-driven transfer cases are quieter and lighter than gear-driven ones. They are used in vehicles such as compact trucks, full size trucks, Jeeps and SUVs. Some off-road driving enthusiasts modify their vehicles to use gear-driven transfer cases, accepting the additional weight and noise to gain the extra strength they generally provide.[citation needed]\nHousing type[edit]\nMarried[edit]', 'Housing type[edit]\nMarried[edit]\nTransfer cases are also classified as either ""divorced""/independent or ""married"". Married transfer cases are bolted directly to the transmission, usually between the transmission\'s output shaft and the rear or main driveshaft. Sometimes a married transfer case is an integral part of the transmission and the two components share the same housing or ""case"", as is commonly found on recent Subaru products and some other all-wheel-drive cars.[citation needed]\nDivorced/independent[edit]', 'Divorced/independent[edit]\nA divorced or independent transfer case is completely separate from the transmission. It is located further down the driveline than a married transfer case and connected to the transmission output shaft by a short driveshaft. Independent transfer cases are used on very long wheelbase vehicles, such as commercial trucks or military trucks.\nTransfer case shift type[edit]\nM.S.O.F.[edit]', 'Manual Shift On-the-Fly transfer cases have a selector lever on the driver\'s side floor transmission hump and may also have either two sealed automatic front axle locking hubs or two manual front axle hub selectors of ""LOCK"" and ""UNLOCK"" or ""FREE"".

In total, 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies, and five for Stationers' Hall copyright, around 1,170 copies were available for sale"", '.[2] Significantly, 500 were taken by Mudie\'s Library, ensuring that the book promptly reached a large number of subscribers to the library.[82] The second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 January 1860,[83] and incorporated numerous corrections as well as a response to religious objections by the addition of a new epigraph on page ii, a quotation from Charles Kingsley, and the phrase ""by the Creator"" added to the closing sentence.[84] During Darwin\'s lifetime the book went through six editions, with cumulative changes and revisions to deal with counter-arguments raised', '. The third edition came out in 1861, with a number of sentences rewritten or added and an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species,[85] while the fourth in 1866 had further revisions. The fifth edition, published on 10 February 1869, incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase ""survival of the fittest"", which had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Biology (1864).[86]', 'In January 1871, George Jackson Mivart\'s On the Genesis of Species listed detailed arguments against natural selection, and claimed it included false metaphysics.[87] Darwin made extensive revisions to the sixth edition of the Origin (this was the first edition in which he used the word ""evolution"" which had commonly been associated with embryological development, though all editions concluded with the word ""evolved""[88][89]), and added a new chapter VII, Miscellaneous objections, to address Mivart\'s arguments.[2][90]', 'The sixth edition was published by Murray on 19 February 1872 as The Origin of Species, with ""On"" dropped from the title. Darwin had told Murray of working men in Lancashire clubbing together to buy the 5th edition at fifteen shillings and wanted it made more widely available; the price was halved to 7s 6d by printing in a smaller font.

In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats.', 'The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of haemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy. Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Structure\n1.1 Microanatomy\n1.2 Variation\n1.3 Development\n2 Function', '1.2 Variation\n1.3 Development\n2 Function\n3 Clinical significance\n3.1 Gallstones\n3.2 Inflammation\n3.3 Gallbladder removal\n3.4 Cancer\n3.5 Tests\n4 Society and culture\n5 Other animals\n6 History\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\nStructure[edit]', '8 References\n9 External links\nStructure[edit]\nThe gallbladder is a hollow organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the liver, that is grey-blue in life.[2] In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and 4 centimetres (1.6\xa0in) in diameter when fully distended.[3] The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces).[2]', '. Bile is stored in the gallbladder for release when food is discharged into the duodenum and also after a few hours.[22]', 'Gallbladder[edit]\nThe gallbladder is a hollow part of the biliary tract that sits just beneath the liver, with the gallbladder body resting in a small depression.[23] It is a small organ where the bile produced by the liver is stored, before being released into the small intestine. Bile flows from the liver through the bile ducts and into the gall bladder for storage. The bile is released in response to cholecystokinin (CCK) a peptide hormone released from the duodenum. The production of CCK (by endocrine cells of the duodenum) is stimulated by the presence of fat in the duodenum.[24]', ""It is divided into three sections, a fundus, body and neck. The neck tapers and connects to the biliary tract via the cystic duct, which then joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. At this junction is a mucosal fold called Hartmann's pouch, where gallstones commonly get stuck. The muscular layer of the body is of smooth muscle tissue that helps the gallbladder contract, so that it can discharge its bile into the bile duct. The gallbladder needs to store bile in a natural, semi-liquid form at all times"", "". Hydrogen ions secreted from the inner lining of the gallbladder keep the bile acidic enough to prevent hardening. To dilute the bile, water and electrolytes from the digestion system are added. Also, salts attach themselves to cholesterol molecules in the bile to keep them from crystallising. If there is too much cholesterol or bilirubin in the bile, or if the gallbladder doesn't empty properly the systems can fail. This is how gallstones form when a small piece of calcium gets coated with either cholesterol or bilirubin and the bile crystallises and forms a gallstone"", '. The main purpose of the gallbladder is to store and release bile, or gall. Bile is released into the small intestine in order to help in the digestion of fats by breaking down larger molecules into smaller ones. After the fat is absorbed, the bile is also absorbed and transported back to the liver for reuse.']",beneath the liver

In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.', 'Most organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far-red radiation.[17]', 'Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some archea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.[18][19]\nPhotosynthetic membranes and organelles\nChloroplast ultrastructure:', 'The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons.[6] Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth,[7] which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130\xa0terawatts,[8][9][10] which is about three times the current power consumption of human civilization', '.[11] Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 thousand million metric tonnes of carbon into biomass per year.[12][13]', 'Contents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Overview\n2 Photosynthetic membranes and organelles\n3 Light-dependent reactions\n3.1 Z scheme\n3.2 Water photolysis\n4 Light-independent reactions\n4.1 Calvin cycle\n4.2 Carbon concentrating mechanisms\n4.2.1 On land\n4.2.2 In water\n5 Order and kinetics\n6 Efficiency\n7 Evolution\n7.1 Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts\n7.2 Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis\n8 Discovery\n8.1 Development of the concept\n8.2 C3\xa0: C4 photosynthesis research\n9 Factors\n9.1 Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature\n9.2 Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration\n10 See also', '10 See also\n11 References\n12 Further reading\n12.1 Books\n12.2 Papers\n13 External links\nOverview\nPhotosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar.', 'Photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.[4] In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen.

By November 1931, Pooh was a $50\xa0million-a-year business.[21] Slesinger marketed Pooh and his friends for more than 30 years, creating the first Pooh doll, record, board game, puzzle, US radio broadcast (NBC), animation, and motion picture film.[22]\nRed Shirt Pooh', ""Red Shirt Pooh\nThe first time Pooh and his friends appeared in colour was 1932, when he was drawn by Slesinger in his now-familiar red shirt and featured on an RCA Victor picture record.

For other uses, see Shortwave (disambiguation).\nGrundig Satellit 400 solid-state, digital shortwave receiver, circa 1986 [1]', 'Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave radio frequencies. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), and generally extends from 1.7–30\xa0MHz (176.3–10.0\xa0m); from the high end of the medium frequency band (MF) just above the mediumwave AM broadcast band, to the end of the HF band.', 'Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon. This is called skywave or ""skip"" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about 40 miles (64\xa0km)', '. Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. It is also used for military over-the-horizon radar, diplomatic communication, and two-way international communication by amateur radio enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes, as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications.', ""Contents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Frequency classifications\n2 History\n2.1 Development\n2.2 Amateur use of shortwave propagation\n3 Propagation characteristics\n4 Types of modulation\n5 Users\n6 Shortwave broadcasting\n6.1 Frequency allocations\n6.2 Advantages\n6.3 Disadvantages\n7 Shortwave listening\n8 Shortwave broadcasts and music\n9 Shortwave's future\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 External links\nFrequency classifications[edit]"", 'Amplitude modulation is the simplest type and the most commonly used for shortwave broadcasting. The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal (speech, or music, for example). At the receiver, a simple detector recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier.', 'Single sideband transmission is a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation. An amplitude-modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the carrier frequency. If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier, only the remaining set is transmitted. This reduces power in the transmission, as roughly 2/3 of the energy sent by an AM signal is unnecessary to recover the information contained on it. It also reduces ""bandwidth"", enabling about one-half the carrier frequency spectrum width to be used', "". The drawback is the receiver is more complicated, since it must re-create the carrier to recover the signal. Small errors in the detection process greatly affect the pitch of the received signal. As a result, single sideband is not used for music or general broadcast. Single sideband is used for long-range voice communications by ships and aircraft, Citizen's Band, and amateur radio operators. Lower sideband (LSB) is generally used below 9\xa0MHz and USB (upper sideband) above 9\xa0MHz."", 'Vestigal sideband transmits the carrier and one complete sideband, but filters out the other sideband. It is a compromise between AM and SSB, enabing simple receivers to be used, but requires almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It can be heard in the transmission of certain radio time signal stations. Vestigial sideband is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and digital.', 'Continuous wave (CW) is on-and-off keying of a carrier, used for Morse code communications and Hellschreiber facsimile-based teleprinter transmissions.[21]\nNarrow-band frequency modulation (NBFM) is used typically above 20\xa0MHz. Because of the larger bandwidth required, NBFM is commonly used for VHF communication. Regulations limit the bandwidth of a signal transmitted in the HF bands, and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth. NBFM is limited to short-range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere.[22]']",MFSK

Ecologically, it includes diverse ecoregions such as the Atlantic coastal desert, North Saharan steppe and woodlands, Sahara Desert, and South Saharan steppe and woodlands.

86,where is most vascular tissue found in plants,"Most vascular tissue in plants is found in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles, which include both xylem and phloem. These bundles are arranged in stems, roots, and leaves. In stems and roots, xylem typically lies closer to the interior with phloem towards the exterior. In leaves, xylem is oriented toward the adaxial surface and phloem toward the abaxial surface.","['Vascular tissue - Wikipedia\n \nVascular tissue \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nCross section of celery stalk, showing vascular bundles, which include both phloem and xylem.\nDetail of the vasculature of a bramble leaf.\nThis article is about vascular tissue in plants. For transport in animals, see Circulatory system.', 'Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue, formed of more than one cell type, found in vascular plants. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant.', 'The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes. The individual cells of phloem are connected end-to-end, just as the sections of a pipe might be. As the plant grows, new vascular tissue differentiates in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant', '. The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles. These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells. In stems and roots, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem. In the stems of some Asterales dicots, there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well.', 'Between the xylem and phloem is a meristem called the vascular cambium. This tissue divides off cells that will become additional xylem and phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length. As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem', 'In leaves, the vascular bundles are located among the spongy mesophyll. The xylem is oriented toward the adaxial surface of the leaf (usually the upper side), and phloem is oriented toward the abaxial surface of the leaf. This is why aphids are typically found on the underside of the leaves rather than on the top, since the phloem transports sugars manufactured by the plant and they are closer to the lower surface.[citation needed]\nSee also[edit]\nXylem\nPhloem\nCork cambium\nVascular cambium\nVascular plant\nStele (biology)\nCirculatory system\nExternal links[edit]', 'Circulatory system\nExternal links[edit]\nIntro to Plant Structure Contains diagrams of the plant tissues, listed as an outline.\n[show]\nv\nt\ne\nBiological tissues\nAnimals\nEpithelial\nConnective\nMuscular\nNervous\nPlants\nDermal tissue\nEpidermis: Cuticle\nPavement cell\nGuard cell\nSubsidiary cell\nPeriderm: Phellem\nPhelloderm\nVascular tissue\nPhloem: Sieve tube\nCompanion cell\nPhloem fiber\nPhloem parenchyma\nXylem: Tracheid\nVessel element\nXylem fiber\nXylem parenchyma\nGround tissue\nParenchyma: Chlorenchyma\nAerenchyma\nCollenchyma\nSclerenchyma: Sclereid\nFiber\nMeristematic tissue\nPrimary: Protoderm\nProcambium', 'Meristematic tissue\nPrimary: Protoderm\nProcambium\nGround meristem\nSecondary: Cork cambium\nVascular cambium\n[show]\nv\nt\ne\nBotany\nHistory of botany\nSubdisciplines\nPlant systematics\nEthnobotany\nPaleobotany\nPlant anatomy\nPlant ecology\nPhytogeography\nGeobotany\nFlora\nPhytochemistry\nPlant pathology\nBryology\nPhycology\nFloristics\nDendrology\nPlant groups\nAlgae\nArchaeplastida\nBryophyte\nNon-vascular plants\nVascular plants\nSpermatophytes\nPteridophyte\nGymnosperm\nAngiosperm\nPlant morphology\n(glossary)\nPlant cells\nCell wall\nPhragmoplast\nPlastid\nPlasmodesma\nVacuole\nTissues\nMeristem\nVascular tissue', 'Vacuole\nTissues\nMeristem\nVascular tissue\nVascular bundle\nGround tissue\nMesophyll\nCork\nWood\nStorage organs\nVegetative\nRoot\nRhizoid\nBulb\nRhizome\nShoot\nStem\nLeaf\nPetiole\nCataphyll\nBud\nSessility\nReproductive\n(Flower)\nFlower development\nInflorescence\nUmbel\nRaceme\nBract\nPedicellate\nFlower\nWhorl\nFloral symmetry\nFloral diagram\nFloral formula\nReceptacle\nHypanthium (Floral cup)\nPerianth\nTepal\nPetal\nSepal\nSporophyll\nGynoecium\nOvary\nOvule\nStigma\nArchegonium\nAndroecium\nStamen\nStaminode\nPollen\nTapetum\nGynandrium\nGametophyte\nSporophyte\nPlant embryo\nFruit\nFruit anatomy\nBerry\nCapsule\nSeed\nSeed dispersal', 'Fruit anatomy\nBerry\nCapsule\nSeed\nSeed dispersal\nEndosperm\nSurface structures\nEpicuticular wax\nPlant cuticle\nEpidermis\nStoma\nNectary\nTrichome\nPrickle\nPlant physiology\nMaterials\nNutrition\nPhotosynthesis\nChlorophyll\nPlant hormone\nTranspiration\nTurgor pressure\nBulk flow\nAleurone\nPhytomelanin\nSugar\nSap\nStarch\nCellulose\nPlant growth and habit\nSecondary growth\nWoody plants\nHerbaceous plants\nHabit\nVines\nLianas\nShrubs\nSubshrubs\nTrees\nSucculent plants\nReproduction\nEvolution\nEcology\nAlternation of generations\nSporangium\nSpore\nMicrosporangia\nMicrospore\nMegasporangium\nMegaspore\nPollination\nPollinators']",No answer

Populations in the western Pacific around Japan are sometimes distinguished as Cyanea nozakii, or as a subspecies, C. c. nozakii', ""Ecology[edit]\nAs coldwater species, these jellyfish cannot cope with warmer waters. The jellyfish are pelagic for most of their lives but tend to settle in shallow, sheltered bays towards the end of their one-year lifespan. In the open ocean, lion's mane jellyfish act as floating oases for certain species, such as shrimp, medusafish, butterfish, harvestfish, and juvenile prowfish, providing both a reliable source of food and protection from predators[citation needed]."", ""Predators of the lion's mane jellyfish include seabirds, larger fish such as ocean sunfish, other jellyfish species, and sea turtles.[9] The leatherback sea turtle feeds almost exclusively on them in large quantities during the summer season around Eastern Canada.[10] The jellyfish themselves feed mostly on zooplankton, small fish, ctenophores, and moon jellies.[11]\nBehavior and reproduction[edit]\nMain article: Jellyfish §\xa0Life cycle\nLion's mane jellyfish swimming, side view"", ""Lion's mane jellyfish swimming, side view\nLion's mane jellyfish remain mostly very near the surface, at no more than 20\xa0m depth.

The jellyfish are most often spotted during the late summer and autumn, when they have grown to a large size and the currents begin to sweep them to shore."", ""Like other jellyfish, lion's manes are capable of both sexual reproduction in the medusa stage and asexual reproduction in the polyp stage.[9] Lion's mane jellyfish have four different stages in their year-long lifespan: a larval stage, a polyp stage, an ephyrae stage, and the medusa stage.[9] The female jellyfish carries its fertilized eggs in its tentacle, where the eggs grow into larva. When the larva are old enough, the female deposits them on a hard surface, where the larva soon grow into polyps. The polyps begin to reproduce asexually, creating stacks of small creatures called ephyrae"", '.[12] The individual ephyrae break off the stacks, where they eventually grow into the medusa stage and become full grown jellyfish.[13]']",C. capillata

94,when did they stop making pull tabs on beer cans,No answer,"['In 1959, Ermal Fraze devised a can-opening method that would come to dominate the canned beverage market. His invention was the ""pull-tab"". This eliminated the need for a separate opener tool by attaching an aluminium pull-ring lever with a rivet to a pre-scored wedge-shaped tab section of the can top. The ring was riveted to the center of the top, which created an elongated opening large enough that one hole simultaneously served to let the beverage flow out while air flowed in. In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr', '. In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr. Fraze had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he later stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab.[4] Pull-tab cans, or the discarded tabs from them, were also called ""pop-tops"" colloquially. In Australia these were colloquially known as ""ring-pull""', '. Into the 1970s, the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with a significant problem, as people would frequently discard the pull-tabs on the ground as litter, or drop them into the can and risk choking on them. These problems were both addressed by the invention of the ""push-tab"". Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up', "". It needed no ring to pull up. Instead, the raised aluminium blister was pushed down into the can, with a small unscored piece that kept the tab connected after being pushed inside. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person's finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening"", '. An unusual feature of the push-tab Coors Beer cans was that they had a second, smaller, push-tab at the top as an airflow vent\xa0— a convenience that was lost with the switch from can opener to pull-tab. The ""push-tab"" was introduced into Australia in the early 1980s and was locally known as ""pop-tops"".', 'Beer can pop-top display at a Budweiser Brewery\nEarly metal beverage cans had no tabs; they were opened by a can-piercer or churchkey, a device resembling a bottle opener with a sharp point. The can was opened by punching two triangular holes in the lid—a large one for drinking, and a second (smaller) one to admit air.\nAs early as 1922, inventors were applying for patents on cans with tab tops, but the technology of the time made these inventions impractical.[14] Later advancements saw the ends of the can made out of aluminium instead of steel.', 'Cans are usually in sealed paperboard cartons, corrugated fiberboard boxes, or trays covered with plastic film. The entire distribution system and packaging need to be controlled to ensure freshness.[15]\nPop-tab[edit]\nOld style pull-tab in use on a can of Tsingtao beer in Beijing, China in 2009', 'Mikolaj Kondakow and James Wong of Thunder Bay,[dubious – discuss] Ontario, Canada invented the pull tab version for bottles in or before 1951 (Canadian patent 476789).[16] Then, in 1962, Ermal Cleon Fraze (1913–1989)[17] of Dayton, Ohio, United States, invented the similar integral rivet and pull-tab version (also known as ring pull in British English), which had a ring attached at the rivet for pulling, and which would come off completely to be discarded. He received US Patent No', '. He received US Patent No. 3,349,949 for his pull-top can design in 1963 and licensed his invention to Alcoa and Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the latter of which first introduced the design on Iron City Beer cans.

Long sentences are avoided; symbols or abbreviations are used instead. To assist with future reviews, relevant questions (which should be recorded as soon as possible so that the lecture and questions will be fresh in the student's mind) or key words are written in the key word column. These notes can be taken from any source of information, such as fiction books, DVDs, lectures, text books, etc.[2]"", 'Within 24 hours of taking the notes, the student must revise and write questions and then write a brief summary in the bottom five to seven lines of the page.

The student is encouraged to reflect on the material and review the notes regularly.[3]', 'Studies on effectiveness[edit]\nA study published in 2010 by Wichita State University compared two note taking methods in a secondary English classroom, and found that Cornell Note taking may be of added benefit in cases where students are required to synthesize and apply learned knowledge, while the guided notes method appeared to be better for basic recall.[4]\nCornell format is one of the most frequently suggested note taking format by university websites for student support.

This was not the only pencil-making occurring in Concord', "". According to Henry Petroski,[citation needed] transcendentalist philosopher Henry David Thoreau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the binder; this invention was prompted by his father's pencil factory in Concord, which employed graphite found in New Hampshire in 1821 by Charles Dunbar."", ""Munroe's method of making pencils was painstakingly slow, and in the neighbouring town of Acton, a pencil mill owner named Ebenezer Wood set out to automate the process at his own pencil mill located at Nashoba Brook.

Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale)"", '. Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success', "".[8] Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich.[8] In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age.

106,name a food you might eat on thanksgiving,Turkey,"[""The consumption of turkey on Thanksgiving is so ingrained in American culture that each year since 1947, the National Turkey Federation has presented a live turkey to the President of the United States prior to each Thanksgiving. These turkeys were initially slaughtered and eaten for the President's Thanksgiving dinner; since 1989, the presented turkeys have typically been given a mock pardon to great fanfare and sent to a park to live out the rest of their usually short natural lives.\nAlternatives to turkey[edit]"", 'Non-traditional foods other than turkey are sometimes served as the main dish for a Thanksgiving dinner. Ham is often served alongside turkey in many non-traditional households. Goose and duck, foods which were traditional European centerpieces of Christmas dinners before being displaced, are now sometimes served in place of the Thanksgiving turkey. Sometimes, fowl native to the region where the meal is taking place is used; for example, an article in Texas Monthly magazine suggested quail as the main dish for a Texan Thanksgiving feast', '. John Madden, who appeared on television for the NFL Thanksgiving Day game from 1981 to 2001, frequently advocated his fondness for the turducken, deboned turkey, duck and chicken nested inside each other then cooked.[13] In a few areas of the West Coast of the United States, Dungeness crab is common as an alternate main dish, as crab season starts in early November. Similarly, Thanksgiving falls within deer hunting season in the Northeastern United States, which encourages the use of venison as a centerpiece', '. Vegetarians or vegans may have a tofu, wheat gluten or lentil-based substitute; or stuffed squash. In Alaskan villages, whale meat is sometimes eaten.[14]Irish immigrants have been known to have prime rib of beef as their centerpiece since beef in Ireland was once a rarity; families would save up money for this dish to signify newfound prosperity and hope.', 'In the United States, a globalist approach to Thanksgiving has become common with the impact of immigration.

A disputed Himalayan border was the main pretext for war, but other issues played a role. There had been a series of violent border incidents after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India had granted asylum to the Dalai Lama', '.

The Indian Intelligence Bureau received information about a Chinese buildup along the border which could be a precursor to war.[56]', 'During June–July 1962, Indian military planners began advocating ""probing actions"" against the Chinese, and accordingly, moved mountain troops forward to cut off Chinese supply lines.

114,what causes cracked skin at the corners of your mouth,"Cracked skin at the corners of your mouth can be caused by habits like chronic lip licking, thumb sucking, dental cleaning, chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling, and mouth breathing. Other potential causes include nutritional deficiencies, systemic disorders, drugs, allergic contact dermatitis, and poor-fitting dentures. Sunscreen in expired lip balms can also contribute to the problem.","['. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws),[9] which extenuates the angular skin folds at the corners of the mouth,[14] in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. The tendency of saliva to pool in these areas is increased, constantly wetting the area,[10] which may cause tissue maceration and favors the development of a yeast infection.[14] As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth).[9] It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth', '.[16] Angular cheilitis is also commonly seen in denture wearers.[13] Angular cheilitis is present in about 30% of people with denture-related stomatitis.[10] It is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with angular cheilitis and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have angular cheilitis.[2] Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking.[2]', 'Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing.[2][4][14] Some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic, and do not consider this to be true angular cheilitis,[4] instead calling it perlèche (derived from the French word pourlècher meaning ""to lick one’s lips""),[2] or ""factitious cheilitis"" is applied to this habit', '.[2] The term ""cheilocandidiasis"" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking.[14] Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Individuals may lick their lips in an attempt to provide a temporary moment of relief, only serving to worsen the condition.[17]', 'The sunscreen in some types of lip balm degrades over time into an irritant. Using expired lipbalm can initiate mild angular cheilitis, and when the person applies more lipbalm to alleviate the cracking, it only aggravates it.

The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth,[4] but sometimes only one side may be affected', '. In some cases, the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips, and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border (the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face) onto the facial skin. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness).[2] Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth.[2][4] The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied', '.[2][4] There is not usually any bleeding.[7] Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin.[4] If Staphylococcus aureus is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts.[8] In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue.[2][4]', 'Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (""collapse of jaws"").[9] If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis']",infection

Between 1934 and 2013 the date has been as early as January 3,[6] and as late as February 12.[7]', 'While not required to deliver a speech, every president since Woodrow Wilson, with the notable exception of Herbert Hoover,[8] has made at least one State of the Union report as a speech delivered before a joint session of Congress. Before that time, most presidents delivered the State of the Union as a written report.[6]', 'Since Franklin Roosevelt, the State of the Union is given typically each January before a joint session of the United States Congress and is held in the House of Representatives chamber of the United States Capitol. Newly inaugurated presidents generally deliver an address to Congress in February of the first year of their term, but this speech is not officially considered to be a ""State of the Union"".[6]', ""What began as a communication between president and Congress has become a communication between the president and the people of the United States. Since the advent of radio, and then television, the speech has been broadcast live on most networks, preempting scheduled programming. To reach the largest audience, the speech, once given during the day, is now typically given in the evening, after 9pm\xa0ET\xa0(UTC-5).\nHistory[edit]\nGeorge Washington's handwritten notes for the first State of the Union Address, January 8, 1790.

In 1801, Thomas Jefferson discontinued the practice of delivering the address in person, regarding it as too monarchical (similar to the Speech from the Throne). Instead, the address was written and then sent to Congress to be read by a clerk until 1913 when Woodrow Wilson re-established the practice despite some initial controversy.

UNIX 03 certification was achieved for the Intel version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[12] and all releases from Mac OS X 10', '4.8 Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard\n4.9 Mac OS X 10.7 Lion\n4.10 OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion\n4.11 OS X 10.9 Mavericks\n4.12 OS X 10.10 Yosemite\n4.13 OS X 10.11 El Capitan\n4.14 macOS 10.12 Sierra\n4.15 macOS 10.13 High Sierra\n5 Reception\n5.1 Usage share\n5.2 Malware and spyware\n5.3 Promotion\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\nHistory\nDevelopment\nSimplified history of Unix-like operating systems\nMain article: History of macOS', 'Main article: History of macOS\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, and then launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of BSD. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.', 'Throughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a ""next-generation"" OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all of them were eventually abandoned.[23] This led Apple to purchase NeXT in 1996, allowing NeXTSTEP, then called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple\'s next generation operating system', '.[24] This purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple\'s primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first code named ""Rhapsody"" and then officially named Mac OS X.[25][26]', 'Mac OS X\nLaunch of Mac OS X\nMac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple\'s operating system for Macintosh computers; current versions of macOS retain the major version number ""10"". Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, as with Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. The letter ""X"" in Mac OS X\'s name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral. It is therefore correctly pronounced ""ten"" /tɛn/ in this context.[27][28] However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter ""X"" /ɛks/.[29]']",10.13.4

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans,[1] as well as among church leaders and among women in general', '. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe.[2] Over time, especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe.', 'As U.S. president, it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs: while the country was at peace, the domestic economy ran on a laissez-faire basis, with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France — funds that were in large part used to buy munitions, raw materials, and food from across the Atlantic. Until 1917, Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing, despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness. He did however expand the United States Navy.', ""In 1917, with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war, and with Britain and France low on credit, Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe,[3] while Germany's ally, the Ottoman Empire, clung stubbornly to its possessions in the Middle East. In the same year, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war"", 'On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war. In the Senate, the resolution passed 82 to 6, with Senators Harry Lane, William J. Stone, James Vardaman, Asle Gronna, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and George W. Norris voting against it. In the House, the declaration passed 373 to 50, with Claude Kitchin, a senior Democrat, notably opposing it. Another opponent was Jeannette Rankin, who alone voted against entry into both World War I and World War II. Nearly all of the opposition came from the West and the Midwest.[107]\nAustria-Hungary[edit]', ""Austria-Hungary[edit]\nThe United States Senate, in a 74 to 0 vote, declared war on Austria-Hungary on December 7, 1917, citing Austria-Hungary's severing of diplomatic relations with the United States, its use of unrestricted submarine warfare and its alliance with Germany.[5] The declaration passed in the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 365 to 1.[6]\nSee also[edit]\nWorld War I portal\nCauses of World War I\nDiplomatic history of World War I\nUnited States in World War I\nUnited States home front during World War I\nFootnotes[edit]"", 'Footnotes[edit]\nJump up ^ Jeanette Keith (2004).

It is one of the best known Arthurian stories, with its plot combining two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel,[1] it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition', '. It is an important example of a chivalric romance, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess, and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings from J. R. R. Tolkien, Simon Armitage, and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.', 'It describes how Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur\'s Round Table, accepts a challenge from a mysterious ""Green Knight"" who challenges any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow, at which the Green Knight stands up, picks up his head, and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates chivalry and loyalty until his honour is called into question by a test involving Lady Bertilak, the lady of the Green Knight\'s castle.', 'The poem survives in a single manuscript, the Cotton Nero A.x., which also includes three religious narrative poems: Pearl, Purity and Patience.

140,what caused the breakup of the democratic republican party,"The breakup of the Democratic-Republican Party occurred due to internal divisions following the 1824 presidential election, where the election was thrown to the House of Representatives. Henry Clay supported John Quincy Adams against Andrew Jackson, leading to Jackson's eventual victory in 1828. This event resulted in the formation of the Jacksonian movement, which later became the Democratic Party, and the National Republican Party, which eventually merged with the Whig Party.

It began in 1791 as one faction in Congress and included many politicians who had been opposed to the new constitution"", '. They called themselves ""Republicans"" after their ideology, republicanism. They distrusted the Federalist commitment to republicanism. The party splintered in 1824 into the Jacksonian movement (which became the Democratic Party in 1828) and the short-lived National Republican Party (later succeeded by the Whig Party).', 'The term ""Democratic-Republican"" is used especially by modern political scientists for the first ""Republican Party"" (as opposed to the modern Republican Party founded in 1854). It is also known as the Jeffersonian Republicans. Historians typically use the title ""Republican Party"". An ""Anti-Administration"" faction met secretly in the national capital (Philadelphia) to oppose Hamilton\'s financial programs. Jefferson denounced the programs as leading to monarchy and subversive of republicanism', '. The name Democratic-Republican was used by contemporaries only occasionally.[31]', 'The term ""republican"" was in widespread usage from the 1770s to describe the type of government the break-away colonies wanted to form: a republic of three separate branches of government derived from some principles and structure from ancient republics; especially the emphasis on civic duty and the opposition to corruption, elitism, aristocracy and monarchy.[32] The word is used in the United States Constitution.[33]\nLegacy[edit]\nFurther information: First Party System and Second Party System', 'A split appeared in the then Republican party during the 1824 elections (at the end of the Monroe administration). When the election was thrown to the House of Representatives, Henry Clay backed John Quincy Adams to deny the presidency to Andrew Jackson, a longtime political rival. Jackson defeated Adams in 1828 and in the next election the first Democratic national convention took place in Baltimore, Maryland on May 21–23, 1832. It nominated Andrew Jackson for a second term and he went on to win the presidential election.', ""The Adams/Clay alliance became the basis of the National Republican Party, a rival to the Jackson's Democracy and one of the successors of the Democratic-Republican Party. This party favored a higher tariff in order to protect U.S. manufacturers, as well as public works, especially roads. Many former members of the defunct Federalist Party, including Daniel Webster, joined the party. After Clay's defeat by Jackson in the 1832 presidential election, the National Republicans were absorbed into the Whig Party, a diverse group of Jackson opponents"", '. Taking a leaf from the Jacksonians, the Whigs tended to nominate non-ideological war heroes as their presidential candidates. The Whig party fell apart in the 1850s over the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery into new territories.']",the disputed 1824 presidential election

This process is called fertilization and typically occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube in humans. The sperm's acrosome releases enzymes to penetrate the egg's outer layers, followed by the fusion of the sperm and egg membranes, leading to the formation of a zygote.","['Gamete - Wikipedia\n \nGamete \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n\t\t\t\t\tJump to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\nPart of a series on\nSex\nBiological terms\nSexual dimorphism\nSexual differentiation\nFeminization\nVirilization\nSex-determination system\nXY\nX0\nZW\nZ0\nTemperature-dependent\nHaplodiploidy\nHeterogametic sex\nHomogametic sex\nSex chromosome\nX chromosome\nY chromosome\nTestis-determining factor\nHermaphrodite\nSequential hermaphroditism\nIntersex\nSexual reproduction\nEvolution of sexual reproduction\nAnisogamy\nIsogamy\nGerm cell\nMeiosis\nGametogenesis\nSpermatogenesis\nOogenesis\nGamete\nspermatozoon\novum', 'Oogenesis\nGamete\nspermatozoon\novum\nFertilization\nExternal fertilization\nInternal fertilization\nSexual selection\nPlant reproduction\nFungal reproduction\nSexual reproduction in animals\nSexual intercourse\nCopulation\nHuman reproduction\nSexuality\nPlant sexuality\nAnimal sexuality\nHuman sexuality\nMechanics\nDifferentiation\nActivity\n Sex portal\n Biology portal\nv\nt\ne', 'A gamete (from Ancient Greek γαμετή gamete from gamein ""to marry""[1]) is a haploid cell that fuses with another haploid cell during fertilization (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum (or egg)—and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type—called a sperm. In short a gamete is an egg (female gamete) or a sperm (male gamete)', '. This is an example of anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell[2][3]). In contrast, isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for mating type. The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one ploidy of each type, and are created through meiosis.', 'Oogenesis is the process of female gamete formation in animals. This process involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary oocyte to produce the haploid ovum (gamete). Spermatogenesis is the process of male gamete formation in animals. This process also involves meiosis (including meiotic recombination) occurring in the diploid primary spermatocyte to produce the haploid spermatozoon (gamete).\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Dissimilarity\n2 Sex determination in humans and birds\n3 Artificial gametes\n4 Plants\n5 Notes and references\nDissimilarity[edit]', 'Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm, usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development. Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century.[1]', 'The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum. The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation, follows with ovulation, and finishes with fertilization. Various exceptions to this sequence are possible, including artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, external ejaculation without copulation, or copulation shortly after ovulation.[2][3][4] Upon encountering the secondary oocyte, the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg', "". The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg's plasma membrane, the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus."", 'In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb, in vitro.\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Anatomy\n1.1 Corona radiata\n1.2 Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane\n1.3 Sperm preparation\n1.4 Zona pellucida\n1.4.1 Cortical reaction\n2 Fusion\n2.1 Cell membranes\n2.2 Transformations\n2.3 Replication\n2.4 Mitosis\n3 Fertilization age\n4 Diseases\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nAnatomy[edit]\nCorona radiata[edit]', 'Anatomy[edit]\nCorona radiata[edit]\nThe sperm binds through the corona radiata, a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte.

Populations are more scattered outside the core area, and the edges of its known distribution range north to the upper peninsula of Michigan, south to northern Louisiana, west to Colorado, and east to Massachusetts [10] In northern Europe, a population was found in Moscow, Russia in 2003.[8] From 2003 to 2016, this population has spread west towards Sweden at 40\xa0km (25\xa0mi) per year and is expected to reach central Europe between 2031 and 2036.[11][12][8]\nHost plants[edit]', 'Host plants[edit]\nIn its native range, emerald ash borer is only a nuisance pest on native trees, as population densities typically do not reach levels lethal to healthy trees.[13] In China, it infests native F. chinensis, F. mandshurica, and F. rhynchophylla; in Japan it also infests F. japonica and F. lanuginosa.[8]', 'Emerald ash borer primarily infest and can cause significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America.[14] In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB.[8] Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds', '.[7] Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but it is unclear whether the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.[7][15]', 'Outside its native range, emerald ash borer is an invasive species that is highly destructive to ash trees in its introduced range.[16] Prior to emerald ash borer being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range aside from a short description of life-history traits and taxonomic descriptions, which resulted in focused research on its biology in North America', '.[6] Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s and its subsequent detection in 2002 in Canton, Michigan, it has since spread other parts of the North America.[17] It is suspected that it was introduced from overseas in shipping materials such as packing crates.[18]', 'Invasiveness and spread[edit]\nWithout factors that would normally suppress emerald ash borer populations in its native range (e.g., resistant trees, predators, and parasitoid wasps), populations can quickly rise to damaging levels.[6] After initial infestation, all ash trees are expected to die in an area within 10 years without control measures.[6] Every North American ash species has susceptibility to emerald ash borer, as North American species planted in China also have high mortality due to infestations, but some Chinese ash species are resistant.[19][20]', 'Green ash and black ash trees are preferred by emerald ash borer. White ash is also killed rapidly, but usually only after all green and black ash trees are eliminated. Blue ash displays some resistance to the emerald ash borer by forming callus tissue around emerald ash borer galleries, but is eventually killed.[21] Many of the specialized predators and parasitoids that suppressed emerald ash borer in Asia were not present in North America.

155,global trade during the ming dynasty of china,"Global trade during the Ming Dynasty of China was characterized by significant engagement with Europe and Japan. The Ming dynasty traded extensively, importing silver and European firearms while exporting various goods. The Hongwu Emperor initially restricted trade but later relaxed these policies, leading to a thriving economy supported by canals, roads, and bridges constructed by the Ming government. Merchant clans like the Huai and Jin clans grew wealthy, and there was fusion between the gentry and merchant classes. Taxation was relatively light, contributing to increased trade but weakening the state's financial position. Agricultural surpluses contributed to the development of a market economy and the emergence of commercial plantations.","['The third type of market was the ""national market"" which was developed during the Song dynasty but particularly enhanced during the Ming. This market involved not only the exchange described above, but also products produced directly for the market. Unlike earlier dynasties, many Ming peasants were no longer producing only products they needed; many of them produced products for the market, which then they sold at a profit.[6]\nTrade and investment[edit]\nMain article: Haijin', 'Trade and investment[edit]\nMain article: Haijin\nIn the early Ming, after the devastation of the war which expelled the Mongols, the Hongwu Emperor imposed severe restrictions on trade (the ""haijin""). Believing that agriculture was the basis of the economy, Hongwu favored that industry over all else, including that of merchants. After his death, most of his policies were reversed by his successors. By the late Ming, the state was losing power to the very merchants which Hongwu had wanted to restrict.', ""The Ming dynasty also engaged in a thriving trade with both Europe and Japan. The amount of silver flowing into the Ming dynasty was estimated by Joseph Needham at 300 million taels, which is equivalent to more than 190 billion dollars in today's money. In addition to silver, the Ming also imported many European firearms, in order to ensure the modernness of their weapons."", 'Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy, and was aided by the construction of canals, roads, and bridges by the Ming government. The Ming saw the rise of several merchant clans such as the Huai and Jin clans, who disposed of large amounts of wealth. The gentry and merchant classes started to fuse, and the merchants gained power at the expense of the state. Some merchants were reputed to have a treasure of 30 million taels.\nTaxation[edit]', 'Ming taxation was light. Taxes on agriculture were only 1/30 of agricultural produce, and were later reduced to 1/50 of produce. Taxes on commerce amounted to 1/30 of commerce also, but was later reduced to 1.5%. These low taxes spurred trade, but severely weakened the state. Salt, as in earlier dynasties, was an important source of state revenue, but required constant and competent management', 'In order to recover from rule of the Mongols and the wars that followed them, the Hongwu Emperor enacted pro-agricultural policies. The state invested extensively in agricultural canals, reduced taxes on agriculture to 1/30 of the output, and later to 1.5% of agricultural output. Ming farmers also introduced many innovations such as water-powered plows, and new agricultural methods such as crop rotation. This led to a massive agricultural surplus that became the basis of a market economy.[5]\nEmergence of commercial plantations[edit]', 'The Ming saw the rise of commercial plantations who produced crops suitable to their regions. Tea, fruits, paint and other goods were produced on a massive scale by these agricultural plantations. Regional patterns of production established during this period continued into the Qing dynasty.[5] The Columbian exchange brought crops such as corn with these foreign crops. During the Ming, specialized areas also popped up planting large numbers of cash crops that could be sold at markets. Large numbers of peasants abandoned the land to become artisans', '. The population of the Ming boomed; estimates for the population of the Ming range from 160 to 200 million.', 'Rural markets during the Ming[edit]\nMing agriculture was much changed from the earlier areas; firstly, gigantic areas, devoting and specializing in cash crops, sprung up to demand from the new market economy. Secondly, agricultural tools and carts, some water-powered, help to create a gigantic agricultural surplus which formed the basis of the rural economy. Besides rice, other crops were grown on a large scale.[5]', ""Although images of autarkic farmers who had no connection to the rest of China may have some merit for the earlier Han and T'ang dynasties, this was certainly not the case for the Ming dynasty. During the Ming dynasty, the increase in population and the decrease in quality land made it necessary that farmers make a living off cash crops. Many of these markets appeared in the rural countryside, where goods were exchanged and bartered.[6]""]",No answer

The crossover was devised by editor Mike Carlin and the Superman writing team of Dan Jurgens, Roger Stern, Louise Simonson, Jerry Ordway and Karl Kesel. ""The Death of Superman"" began in December 1992 and lasted until October 1993. It was published in Superman, Action Comics, The Adventures of Superman, Superman: The Man of Steel, Justice League America, and Green Lantern.', 'The crossover was conceived after Warner Bros. ordered the Superman writing team to halt production on a story in which Clark Kent (Superman) and Lois Lane would be married until the television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman reached its wedding episode. While brainstorming for new ideas, Ordway jokingly suggested they should kill Superman; Carlin, reflecting on poor sales of the Superman books, decided it was the best option. ""The Death of Superman"" was written to surprise readers and show Superman is not invincible.', '""The Death of Superman"" is divided into three parts. The first, ""Doomsday!"", chronicles Superman\'s deadly fight with the bloodthirsty monster Doomsday and concludes with his apparent death. The second, ""A Funeral for a Friend"", depicts Superman\'s fellow superheroes and the rest of the world mourning to his death and Jonathan Kent\'s eventual heart attack. The final part, ""Reign of the Supermen!"", sees the emergence of four individuals claiming to be Superman and the original Superman\'s return.', 'When news broke that DC planned to kill off Superman, a beloved American pop icon, ""The Death of Superman"" gained unprecedented coverage from the mainstream media and caused a sensation. The majority of the story\'s installments were bestsellers; issue #75, which features Superman\'s death, sold over six million copies and was the top selling comic book issue of 1992. Retrospective reviewers found the story powerful, with some calling it one of the best Superman stories. However, it has also received criticism, with some commentators dismissing it as little more than a publicity stunt', 'The characters established during ""The Death of Superman""—Doomsday, Steel, Superboy, and the Cyborg Superman—would all become recurring characters in DC\'s comics. Superboy and Steel both received their own ongoing series after the story\'s conclusion[6] and Steel went on to star in his own movie, in which he was portrayed by Superman fan Shaquille O\'Neal.[30] Superboy remained a fixture of the DC Universe until he was killed in Infinite Crisis (2005—2006).[6] The Cyborg Superman became a recurring nemesis of Superman and Green Lantern', '.[6] Doomsday\'s origin story was explored in Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey (1995)[12] and the character returned in later storylines, most notably in ""Reign of Doomsday"" (2011), which heavily references ""The Death of Superman"" and features Doomsday hunting down Steel, Superboy, Eradicator, and the Cyborg Superman.[31]', 'In 2011, DC relaunched its entire comics line in an initiative called the New 52, which revamped the DC Universe and erased certain events. Superman was altered considerably, being shorter-tempered and was no longer in love with Lois Lane.[32] However, ""The Death of Superman"" remained intact in the new DC Universe.[33]\nIn other media[edit]', 'In other media[edit]\nRoger Stern wrote a novelization of ""The Death of Superman"", The Death and Life of Superman, in 1993 (hardcover ISBN\xa00-553-09582-X; paperback ISBN\xa00-553-56930-9). A young adult book was written by Louise Simonson under the title Superman: Doomsday & Beyond and released at the same time as the hardcover of Death and Life. It features cover art by Alex Ross (ISBN\xa00-553-48168-1).', ""A video game based on the story, The Death and Return of Superman, was developed by Blizzard Entertainment and Sunsoft and released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and 1995 for the Sega Genesis.

The primary mission of the CHP is to ensure safety and enforce traffic laws on all California highways and county roads in unincorporated areas. The CHP promotes traffic safety by inspecting commercial vehicles, as well as inspecting and certifying school buses, ambulances, and other specialized vehicles.', 'The California State Legislature established the California Highway Patrol as a branch of the Division of Motor Vehicles in the Department of Public Works, with legislation signed by Governor C.\xa0C.\xa0Young on August 14, 1929. It was established as a separate department by Governor Earl Warren in 1947. The CHP gradually assumed increased responsibility beyond the enforcement of the State Vehicle Act and eventually merged with the smaller California State Police in 1995.[4] It is currently organized as part of the California State Transportation Agency (CALSTA).', 'In addition to its highway patrol duties, the CHP also provides other services including protecting state buildings and facilities (most notably the California State Capitol) and bodyguarding state officials. The CHP also works with municipal law enforcement agencies, providing assistance in investigations, patrol, and other aspects of law enforcement.\nThe California Highway Patrol is the largest state police agency in the United States, with more than 10,500 employees, 7,608 of whom are sworn officers, according to FBI data[1] and data released by the CHP.[3]\nContents\xa0[hide]', 'As of July 2013, CHP had not purchased patrol vehicles since January 2011 and their fleet was rapidly aging. On average, CHP patrol vehicles are driven 33,000 miles per year. Half of their 2,153-vehicle fleet had over 100,000 miles as of June 2013. After 100,000 miles the warranty on CHP vehicles expires, forcing CHP to pay for maintenance costs. In July 2013, the CHP was authorized to purchase up to 751 new vehicles to begin replacing its aging fleet, starting with cars that have the highest mileage.', 'Through a public, competitive bidding process, the Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle (Explorer) was selected as the new enforcement vehicle for the CHP in 2013. The Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle is All Wheel Drive and powered by a V6, 3.7 Liter engine. It is a Flex Fuel vehicle that can use gasoline or E85 and gets 16 mpg city and 21 mpg highway.\nSeveral Dodge Charger Police Packages were also purchased for testing.', 'The Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor averaged 16 mpg city and 24 mpg highway. The new Ford Police Interceptor Utility Vehicle costs $26,578, which includes a 5-year, 100,000-mile warranty. The Department was paying $24,043 for the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and recently spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per month to maintain all vehicles no longer covered by warranty.', 'Several vehicles were allocated to public affairs officers and are used for recruiting purposes. An example of these vehicles can be seen at the California State Fair and other venues. CHP also uses Chevy Silverados, Dodge Rams (for commercial vehicle enforcement), Ford Expedition, and Chevrolet Tahoe for their divisions that snow frequently or have certain terrains to permit off-road driving.\nIn July 2016, it was announced that the CHP would be taking delivery of 516 2016 Dodge Chargers.[34]', 'In 2017, it was announced that the CHP were going to start using Chevrolet Tahoe Police Patrol Vehicles (PPV) for rural and resident posts.

This contract would eventually lead to the purchase of over 200,000 laptops. Competition to supply this contract was fiercely contested and the major PC companies of the time; IBM Corporation, To shins, Compaq, NEC, and Zenith Data Systems (ZDS), rushed to develop laptops in an attempt to win this deal. ZDS, which had earlier won a landmark deal with the IRS for its Z-171, was awarded this contract for its SupersPort series', "". The SupersPort series was originally launched with an Intel 8086 processor, dual floppy disk drives, a backlit, blue and white STN LCD screen, and a NiCd battery pack. Later models featured an Intel 80286 processor and a 20 MB hard disk drive. On the strength of this deal, ZDS became the world's largest laptop supplier in 1987 and 1988. ZDS partnered with Tottori Sanyo in the design and manufacturing of these laptops. This relationship is notable because it was the first deal between a major brand and an Asian original equipment manufacturer."", 'Hewlett-Packard Vectra Portable CS[edit]\nIn 1987, HP released a portable version of their Vectra CS computer.[8] It had the classic laptop configuration (keyboard and monitor closes up clam-shell style in order to carry), however, it was very heavy and fairly large. It had a full-size keyboard (with separate numeric keypad) and a large amber LCD screen. While it was offered with dual 3.5-inch floppy disk drives, the most common configuration was a 20 MB hard drive and a single floppy drive. It was one of the first machines with a 1.44 MB density 3.5-inch disk drive.\nCambridge Z88[edit]', 'Cambridge Z88[edit]\nAnother notable computer was the Cambridge Z88, designed by Clive Sinclair, introduced in 1988. About the size of an A4 sheet of paper as well, it ran on standard batteries, and contained basic spreadsheet, word processing, and communications programs. It anticipated the future miniaturization of the portable computer, and as a ROM-based machine with a small display, can – like the TRS-80 Model 100 – also be seen as a forerunner of the personal digital assistant.\nCompaq SLT/286[edit]', 'Compaq SLT/286[edit]\nBy the end of the 1980s, laptop computers were becoming popular among business people.

170,what is the role of hcl in the stomach,"Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach plays several roles: 
1. Activates digestive enzymes like pepsinogen to form pepsin for protein breakdown.
2. Denatures proteins, exposing peptide bonds for easier digestion.
3. Provides a highly acidic environment that kills many microorganisms, preventing infections.
4. Works in conjunction with other components to maintain proper pH balance in the stomach and small intestine. 

Citation: [1]","['Gastric acid, gastric juice or stomach acid, is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids. Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed', '. Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate, a base, to buffer the fluid, ensuring that it does not become too acidic. These cells also produce mucus, which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract.', 'The main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid which is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the gastric glands in the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5[1] in the human stomach lumen, the acidity being maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase', '. The parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as an alkaline tide.', ""The highly acidic environment in the stomach lumen causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure (or denature). This exposes the protein's peptide bonds. The gastric chief cells of the stomach secrete enzymes for protein breakdown (inactive pepsinogen, and in infancy rennin). Hydrochloric acid activates pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin, which then helps digestion by breaking the bonds linking amino acids, a process known as proteolysis. In addition, many microorganisms have their growth inhibited by such an acidic environment, which is helpful to prevent infection."", 'Neutralization[edit]\nIn the duodenum, gastric acid is neutralized by sodium bicarbonate. This also blocks gastric enzymes that have their optima in the acid range of pH. The secretion of sodium bicarbonate from the pancreas is stimulated by secretin. This polypeptide hormone gets activated and secreted from so-called S cells in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum when the pH in the duodenum falls below 4.5 to 5.0. The neutralization is described by the equation:\nHCl + NaHCO3 → NaCl + H2CO3', 'HCl + NaHCO3 → NaCl + H2CO3\nThe carbonic acid rapidly equilibrates with carbon dioxide and water through catalysis by carbonic anhydrase enzymes bound to the gut epithelial lining,[6] leading to a net release of carbon dioxide gas within the lumen associated with neutralisation. In the absorptive upper intestine, such as the duodenum, both the dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid will tend to equilibrate with the blood, leading to most of the gas produced on neutralisation being exhaled through the lungs.\nRole in disease[edit]', 'Role in disease[edit]\nIn hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria, there is low or no gastric acid in the stomach, potentially leading to problems as the disinfectant properties of the gastric lumen are decreased. In such conditions, there is greater risk of infections of the digestive tract (such as infection with Vibrio or Helicobacter bacteria).\nIn Zollinger–Ellison syndrome and hypercalcemia, there are increased gastrin levels, leading to excess gastric acid production, which can cause gastric ulcers.', 'In diseases featuring excess vomiting, patients develop hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (decreased blood acidity by H+ and chlorine depletion).\nPharmacology[edit]\nThe proton pump enzyme is the target of proton pump inhibitors, used to increase gastric pH (and hence decrease stomach acidity) in diseases that feature excess acid. H2 antagonists indirectly decrease gastric acid production. Antacids neutralize existing acid.\nHistory[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (November 2010)', 'The role of gastric acid in digestion was established in the 1820s and 1830s by William Beaumont on Alexis St. Martin, who, as a result of an accident, had a fistula (hole) in his stomach, which allowed Beaumont to observe the process of digestion and to extract gastric acid, verifying that acid played a crucial role in digestion.[7]\nSee also[edit]\nStomach\nDigestion\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\nDiscovery and development of proton pump inhibitors\nReferences[edit]\nJump up ^ Marieb EN, Hoehn K (2010).

Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini and his family to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish Eragon', '.

The main arguments in favor of the authenticity of Galatians include its style and themes, which are common to the core letters of the Pauline corpus.[citation needed] Moreover, Paul's possible description of the Council of Jerusalem (Gal.2:1–10) gives a different point of view from the description in Acts 15:2–29, if it is, in fact, describing the Jerusalem Council.[7]"", 'The central dispute in the letter concerns the question of how Gentiles could convert to Christianity, which shows that this letter was written at a very early stage in church history, when the vast majority of Christians were Jewish or Jewish proselytes, which historians refer to as the Jewish Christians. Another indicator that the letter is early is that there is no hint in the letter of a developed organization within the Christian community at large.

Subsequently, the agency's protection was extended to others and in 1890 it became the Legal Aid Society of New York.[2] In 1888, the Ethical Culture Society of Chicago established by the Bureau of Justice was the first agency to offer legal assistance to individuals regardless of nationality, race or gender. Other municipalities followed suit, and in the first decades of the 20th century most major cities had opened legal aid societies.[3]"", 'In 1911, legal aid societies joined together to form the National Alliance of Legal Aid Societies.

Smith challenged the legal profession to consider it an obligation to see that access to justice was available to all, without regard to ability to pay. ""Without equal access to the law,"" he wrote, ""the system not only robs the poor of their only protection, but places in the hands of their oppressors the most powerful and ruthless weapon ever invented.[5]', '. This program flourished and has evolved over the years to become the organization nationally recognized as the Legal Services Corporation.', 'Over the years legal aid has evolved into a comprehensive program that provides legal assistance to low-income people regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. NLADA is the only national membership organization devoted exclusively to ensuring legal representation for individuals who cannot afford an attorney.', 'NLADA serves the equal justice community in two major ways: providing products and services and as a national voice in public policy and legislative debates on the many issues affecting the equal justice community. NLADA also serves as a resource for those seeking more information on equal justice in the United States.', 'In recent years, the NLADA has honored individuals and organizations with a variety of awards at its annual conferences. Awards range from the Mary Ellen Hamilton award, which recognizes a client of a legal aid or defender organization, to the Clara Shortridge Foltz Award, which honors organizations that have pioneered important innovations in the field.

Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value,[1][third-party source needed] however without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria"", "".[2][citation needed] Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options.[third-party source needed] This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating result. Negotiators also need to be aware of the other negotiator's BATNA and to identify how it compares to what they are offering.[3][page\xa0needed]"", 'Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;[4] a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation.[4] Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.[5] According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.', 'Attractive alternatives are needed to develop a strong BATNA.

The story is told in first-person perspective by teenaged protagonist Ponyboy Curtis.', 'The story in the book takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1965,[2] but this is never explicitly stated in the book.\nA film adaptation was produced in 1983, and a little-known short-lived television series appeared in 1990, picking up where the movie left off.

Several greasers, including Ponyboy\'s two older brothers—the paternal Darry and the popular Sodapop—come to his rescue. The next night, Ponyboy and two greaser friends, the hardened Dally and the quiet Johnny, meet Cherry and Marcia, a pair of Soc girls, at a drive-in movie theater. Cherry spurns Dally\'s rude advances, but Ponyboy ends up speaking civilly with Cherry, emotionally connecting with a Soc for the first time in his life.', ""Afterward, Ponyboy, Johnny, and their wisecracking friend Two-Bit begin to walk Cherry and Marcia home, when they are stopped by Cherry's boyfriend Bob, who badly beat up Johnny a few months back. Bob and the greasers exchange taunts, but Cherry prevents a fight by willingly leaving with Bob. Ponyboy gets home at two in the morning, enraging Darry until he suddenly slaps Ponyboy. Ponyboy runs out the door and meets up with Johnny, expressing his anger at Darry's increasing coldness in the wake of his parents' recent deaths in a car crash."", 'Major characters\nGreasers\nPonyboy Curtis: Narrator and the youngest Curtis brother, 14 years old, who gets good grades and runs track.\nSodapop Curtis: The middle Curtis brother, 16 years old, a high school dropout who works at a gas station.\nDarrel ""Darry"" Curtis: The oldest of the Curtis brothers, 20 years old, who has been caring for his brothers since their parents died in a car crash.

Art by Jim Aparo."", ""Over the next few issues, Batman becomes weaker and weaker as each criminal is put away. The rescue of Mayor Krol from the teaming of the Joker and Scarecrow pushes Batman to his mental and physical limits: a dose of Scarecrow's fear gas makes him relive the murder of Jason Todd, which he considers to be his greatest failure. After this encounter, Bane's men assault Batman before he himself makes his move and attacks him at Wayne Manor, his home as his alter-ego—by this time; Bane had deduced the secret identity of Batman. The fight between Bruce Wayne and Bane is detailed in Batman #497"", '. By this time, Batman is so exhausted from the exertion of catching the escaped criminals that he cannot even defend himself; Bane beats him mercilessly before breaking Wayne\'s back over his knee inside the Batcave below the manor, symbolically ""breaking"" Batman.[4] Bane takes the grievously-wounded Wayne (still costumed in the Batman outfit) downtown to Gotham Square and throws him from a rooftop to demonstrate his superiority to the populace. Quick action by Robin and Alfred spares Batman\'s life, but at great cost - he is left a paraplegic', "". With Batman incapacitated, Bane assumes control of Gotham City's underworld and takes over several illegal operations within it."", 'After his defeat, Bruce Wayne enlists the aid of Dr. Shondra Kinsolving to rehabilitate him and asks Jean-Paul Valley to take up the mantle of Batman so that Gotham has a protector. Tim Drake argues with Bruce to allow Dick Grayson (the former Robin and then-current Nightwing) to become Batman, as he is more experienced and mentally competent. Bruce replies that Grayson has his own responsibilities and would only take up the mantle of the Bat reluctantly (Dick later expressed resentment at not being asked to stand in as Batman)', '. Similar stories followed for Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Green Arrow, with Green Lantern Hal Jordan being driven insane and replaced with Kyle Rayner, a new Wonder Woman being appointed by Hippolyta, Aquaman losing his hand, and Green Arrow dying in a plane crash as his long-lost son took over the role.', 'In the opening of the novelisation, KnightFall, Dennis O\'Neil stated that part of the reason ""Knightfall"" was written was due to the recent popularity of more ""ruthless"" heroes such as the Terminator and James Bond in films, as editors were starting to wonder if readers would prefer a Batman who was willing to kill his opponents.\nDuring DC vs. Marvel, Bane attempts to break Captain America\'s back in a fight in a similar maneuver, but is caught off-guard when Captain America\'s shield returns to its owner to strike Bane in the back of the head and knock him out.[6]', ""In the climax to Year One of Injustice: Gods Among Us, Superman confronts Batman in the Batcave as Batman is downloading the formula to a pill that can grant the user superhuman strength and durability, stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. While Superman does not want to kill Batman, he chooses to paralyze him by breaking his back in a similar fashion to Bane (albeit by standing on Batman's back instead of slamming him over his knee as Bane did).

194,the settlers were attracted to oregon for all of the following reasons except,No answer,"[""The Oregon Trail, was the longest of the overland routes used in the westward expansion of the United States, was first traced by explorers and fur traders for traveling to the Oregon Country. The main route of the Oregon Trail stopped at the Hudson's Bay Company Fort Hall, a major resupply route along the trail near present-day Pocatello and where the California Trail split off to the south. Then the Oregon Trail crossed the Snake River Plain of present-day southern Idaho and the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon before reaching the Willamette Valley"", "". It was the only practical way for settlers in wagons without tools, livestock, or supplies to cross the mountains and usually thought critical to the colonization of the American West. Some of the first to travel the Oregon Trail were Christian missionaries, members of the Methodist Episcopal Church who established the Methodist Mission in 1834. Even though they didn't make many converts, they were impressed by the short amount of time needed to reach the Pacific Coast. Rumors about how the sun always shone there and wheat grew as tall as a man attracted American settlers."", 'American settlers began following the trail in 1841, with the first recorded colonist wagon traingroup being the 1843 ""Great Migration"" of about 900 colonists, led by Marcus Whitman. The Provisional Government of Oregon was established by such colonists in 1843, generally limited to the Willamette Valley. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 divided the Oregon Country between Great Britain and the United States, mostly along the 49th parallel. The Territory of Oregon was established shortly afterwards, in 1848, and over 12,000 American settlers made the journey there during the decade.', 'Families usually began their journey at Independence, Missouri, near the Missouri River with the best time to travel being from April to September. The journey to cross the entire Oregon Trail in a covered wagon took from four to six months, following a winding trail 2,000 miles (3,200\xa0km) through prairies, deserts, and across mountains to the Pacific Northwest. The journey was a severe test of strength and endurance so travelers often joined wagon trains traveling about 12–15 miles (19–24\xa0km) per day. Settlers often had to cross flooded rivers', '. Settlers often had to cross flooded rivers. Indians attacked the wagon trains; however, of the 10,000 deaths that occurred from 1835 to 1855, only 4 percent resulted from Indian attacks. Cholera, smallpox, and firearms accidents were the chief causes of death on the trail. Food, water, and wood were always scarce, and the travelers often encountered contaminated water holes. During summer, the trail was crowded with wagon trains, army units, missionaries, hunting parties, traders, and even sightseeing tours', 'In the American Old West, overland trails were popular means of travel used by pioneers and immigrants throughout the 19th century and especially between 1830 and 1870 as an alternative to sea and railroad transport. These immigrants began to settle various regions of North America west of the Great Plains as part of the mass overland migrations of the mid-19th century', '. Settlers emigrating from the eastern United States were spurred by various motives, among them religious persecution, economic incentives, and the prospect of new wealth and new freedoms in what was then a largely unspoiled and unregulated country. By the 1840s, several popular and well-established routes had been blazed through the continental interior to destinations in the far west, including the Oregon Trail, California Trail, and Mormon Trail. After the end of the Mexican–American War in 1849, vast new American conquests again enticed mass immigration', '. Legislation like the Donation Land Claim Act and significant events like the California Gold Rush further lured colonists to travel overland to the west.', 'Two major wagon-based transportation networks, one typically starting in Missouri and the other in the Mexican province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, served the majority of migrants during the era of westward expansion. Three of the Missouri-based routes—the Oregon, Mormon, and California Trails—were collectively known as the Emigrant Trails. Historians have estimated at least 500,000 emigrants used these three trails between 1843 and 1869, and despite growing competition from transcontinental railroads, some use even continued into the early 20th century', '. The major southern routes were the Santa Fe Trail, the Southern Emigrant Trail, and the Old Spanish Trail, as well as its wagon road successor the Mormon Road, a southern spur of the California Trail used in the winter that also made use of the western half of the Old Spanish Trail. Regardless of the trail used, the journey was often slow and arduous, fraught with risks from infectious diseases, dehydration, malnutrition, injury, and harsh weather, with as many as one in ten travelers dying along the way, usually as a result of disease.']",No answer

197,where does the optic nerve cross the midline ​,"The optic nerve crosses the midline at the optic chiasm, located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus.","['[edit on Wikidata]\nThe optic chiasm or optic chiasma ( /ɒptɪk kaɪæzəm/; Greek χίασμα, ""crossing"", from the Greek χιάζω \'to mark with an X\', after the Greek letter \'Χ\', chi) is the part of the brain where the optic nerves partially cross. The optic chiasm is located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus.[1] The optic chiasm is found in all vertebrates, although in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) it is located within the brain.[2][3]\nContents\n\xa0[hide]\xa0\n1 Structure\n2 Other animals\n3 Additional images\n4 History\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nStructure[edit]', '6 References\n7 External links\nStructure[edit]\nThe optic nerve fibres on the nasal sides of each retina cross over (decussate) to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm (decussation of medial fibers). The temporal hemiretina, on the other hand, stays on the same side. The inferonasal retina are related to anterior portion of the optic chiasm whereas superonasal retinal fibers are related to the posterior portion of the optic chiasm.', 'The crossing over of optic nerve fibres at the optic chiasm allows the visual cortex to receive the same hemispheric visual field from both eyes. Superimposing and processing these monocular visual signals allow the visual cortex to generate binocular and stereoscopic vision. For example, the right visual cortex receives the temporal visual field from the left eye, and the nasal visual field from the right eye, which results in the right visual cortex producing a binocular image of the left hemispheric visual field', '. The net result of optic nerve crossing over at the optic chiasm is for the right cerebral hemisphere to sense and process left hemispheric vision, and for the left cerebral hemisphere to sense and process right hemispheric vision.[4]', 'This crossing is an adaptive feature of frontally oriented eyes, found mostly in predatory animals requiring precise visual depth perception. (Prey animals, with laterally positioned eyes, have little binocular vision, so there is a more complete crossover of visual signals[citation needed].) Beyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, the optic nerves become optic tracts. The signals are passed on to the lateral geniculate body, in turn giving them to the occipital cortex (the outer matter of the rear brain).[5]\nOther animals[edit]', 'Illustration of the distribution of cone cells in the fovea of an individual with normal color vision (left), and a color blind (protanopic) retina. Note that the center of the fovea holds very few blue-sensitive cones.\nDistribution of rods and cones along a line passing through the fovea and the blind spot of a human eye[8]\nThe vertebrate retina has ten distinct layers.[9] From closest to farthest from the vitreous body:\nInner limiting membrane – basement membrane elaborated by Müller cells.', 'Nerve fibre layer – axons of the ganglion cell nuclei (note that a thin layer of Müller cell footplates exists between this layer and the inner limiting membrane).\nGanglion cell layer – contains nuclei of ganglion cells, the axons of which become the optic nerve fibres for messages and some displaced amacrine cells.[2]\nInner plexiform layer – contains the synapse between the bipolar cell axons and the dendrites of the ganglion and amacrine cells.[2]\nInner nuclear layer – contains the nuclei and surrounding cell bodies (perikarya) of the amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells.[2]', 'Outer plexiform layer – projections of rods and cones ending in the rod spherule and cone pedicle, respectively. These make synapses with dendrites of bipolar cells.[2] In the macular region, this is known as the Fiber layer of Henle.\nOuter nuclear layer – cell bodies of rods and cones.\nExternal limiting membrane – layer that separates the inner segment portions of the photoreceptors from their cell nucleus.\nLayer of rods and cones – layer of rod cells and cone cells.', 'Retinal pigment epithelium – single layer of cuboidal cells (with extrusions not shown in diagram). This is closest to the choroid.\nThese layers can be grouped into 4 main processing stages: photoreception; transmission to bipolar cells; transmission to ganglion cells, which also contain photoreceptors, the photosensitive ganglion cells; and transmission along the optic nerve. At each synaptic stage there are also laterally connecting horizontal and amacrine cells.', 'The optic nerve is a central tract of many axons of ganglion cells connecting primarily to the lateral geniculate body, a visual relay station in the diencephalon (the rear of the forebrain). It also projects to the superior colliculus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the nucleus of the optic tract. It passes through the other layers, creating the optic disc in primates.[10]']",optic chiasm
